## **HERMENEUTICAL ORDERING: TONAL CONSIDERATIONS**

*What should be in my head, tonally, as I decide which event goes where?*

These are purely feel‑based constraints for sequencing every event under a single apocalyptic sky.

### Global Feel While Placing Any Event

For each placement, ask: "If this were the only thing the reader saw right now, what would they feel, and how will that feeling mutate once the surrounding events are known?"

Keep a constant background sense of *inevitable but not yet arrived judgment*: events should feel like fragments drifting toward a catastrophe the reader intuits but cannot fully map. The ordering should amplify this intuition without ever needing to state it.

### Local Emotional Honesty vs. Global Dread

Let each event keep its own mood intact: joy as joy, terror as terror, banality as banality. When deciding where it goes, the question is not "How do I darken this?" but "What do I put before and after it so that its native feeling is still true, yet uneasy in context?"

Guard against flattening: if the internal meter says, "This scene now feels *less* joyful than the text itself," move it until the joy is restored, even if that increases dread elsewhere. The blood‑red sky comes from the whole arrangement, not from repainting each star.

### Pattern Pressure Without Visible Machinery

As neighbors are chosen for any event, think in terms of *emerging pattern*, not formula: "If the reader has already seen these three rises and collapses, how does placing this next one tilt their sense of the world's moral physics?"

Let recognition do the work. The arrangement is not meant to shout "this always goes bad," but to ensure that the reader, on their own, begins to fear the *kind* of thing they see starting again, even when the moment itself is beautiful.

### Temporal Dislocation as Emotional Tool

When something is moved "out of time," the guiding question is: "Does seeing this *now*, instead of 'when it happened,' intensify the reader's unease without lying about the scene's own feeling?"

Use non‑chronology as emotional shuffling: not solving a puzzle for cleverness' sake, but arranging so that memory, not plot, becomes the primary carrier of dread. The reader's prior experiences in the book should echo loudly whenever a new event is dropped in.

### Breath, Contrast, and Load‑Bearing Points

As a run of events is placed, attend to *breath*: "Is the reader being allowed to fully inhale this joy or horror before being asked to hold something heavier?" The aim is not comfort, but full saturation; no emotion should be half‑felt because of a rush to the next.

Reserve the sharpest contrasts for points meant to feel load‑bearing in the moral architecture. When the gut says, "Putting *that* after *this* feels almost too much," those are the joints where the blood‑red sky thickens.

### Memory, Echo, and Haunting

When choosing where to drop a small or obscure event, ask: "What earlier feeling do I want this to wake back up?" The placement's job is to ring a bell in the reader's memory, not to make a point in the abstract.

Think in terms of *haunting rather than foreshadowing*: the order should make readers feel followed by what they have already seen. If an event, as placed, sends a faint chill backward through the book, it is doing the right kind of work.

The trees seek a king
They ask the olive tree
"Shall I leave my oil by which gods and men are honored?"
They ask the fig tree
"Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit?"
They ask the vine
"Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men?"
They ask the bramble
"If in good faith you are anointing me, come and take refuge in my shade"
"But if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon"
"If you acted in good faith with Jerubbaal"
"But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem"
"And let fire come out from the leaders and devour Abimelech"
Jotham flees to Beer

"That the violence done to the seventy sons may come"
The leaders of Shechem deal treacherously

They go out into the field
They gather the grapes, tread them, hold a festival
They eat and drink in the house of their god
They curse Abimelech
Gaal: "Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him?"
"Is he not the son of Jerubbaal?"
Zebul's anger is kindled
He sends messengers secretly to Abimelech
Abimelech rises by night with his people
Four companies
Gaal goes out and stands in the entrance of the city gate
Abimelech and his people rise from the ambush
Gaal: "Look, people are coming down"
Zebul: "You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men"
Gaal speaks again: "Look, people are coming down"
Zebul: "Where is your mouth now?"
"Go out and fight with them"
Gaal goes out and fights
Abimelech chases him
Many fall wounded up to the entrance of the gate
Zebul drives out Gaal and his relatives
Next day: the people go out into the field

Abimelech is told
Abimelech and all his people go up to Mount Zalmon
He takes an axe
He cuts a bundle of brushwood
He lays it on his shoulder
"Hurry and do as you have seen me do"
Every man cuts his bundle
They pile them against the stronghold
They set the stronghold on fire over the people
About 1,000 men and women die

He encamps against it and captures it
A strong tower within the city
All the leaders flee to it
They shut themselves in
They go up to the roof

He draws near the door to burn it
A woman throws an upper millstone
It crashes on Abimelech's skull
"He called quickly to the young man, his armor-bearer"
"Draw your sword and kill me"
"Lest they say of me, 'A woman killed him'"
His young man thrusts him through
He dies
When the men of Israel see he is dead, they depart
"Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech"
"The curse of Jotham came upon them"
Tola judges Israel twenty-three years
Jair judges Israel twenty-two years

They serve the Baals, the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and the Philistines
The anger of the Lord is kindled
He sells them into the hand of the Philistines and Ammonites
Eighteen years of oppression
Israel cries to the Lord
"We have forsaken our God and have served the Baals"
The Lord: "Did I not save you from the Egyptians?"
"From the Amorites, Ammonites, Philistines?"
"Yet you have forsaken me"
"I will save you no more"
"Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen"
Israel: "We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you"
"Only please deliver us this day"

He passes through Gilead and Manasseh
Jephthah's vow: "If you will give the Ammonites into my hand"
"Whatever comes out from the doors of my house"
"I will offer it up for a burnt offering"

He strikes them with a great blow
Twenty cities
"From Aroer to Minnith, as far as Abel-keramim"
"So the Ammonites were subdued"
Jephthah comes to his home at Mizpah
His daughter comes out to meet him
With tambourines and with dances
She is his only child
"Besides her he had neither son nor daughter"
He sees her
He tears his clothes
"Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low"
"I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot take back my vow"
She: "My father, you have opened your mouth to the Lord"
"Do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth"
"The Lord has avenged you on your enemies"
"Let this thing be done for me"
"Leave me alone two months"
"That I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity"
He says, "Go"
He sends her away for two months
She departs, she and her companions
They weep for her virginity on the mountains
At the end of two months she returns
He does with her according to his vow

Four days a year
Men of Ephraim gather
They cross to Zaphon
"Why did you cross to fight without calling us?"
"We will burn your house over you"

"Why have you come up to me this day to fight?"
Jephthah gathers the men of Gilead
They fight with Ephraim
Gilead strikes Ephraim
"Because they said, 'You are fugitives of Ephraim'"
Gilead captures the fords of the Jordan
When Ephraimites flee: "Let me go over"
Men of Gilead: "Are you an Ephraimite?"

"You shall conceive and bear a son"
"No razor shall come upon his head"
"He shall be a Nazirite from the womb"
"He shall begin to save Israel from the Philistines"
She tells her husband
Manoah prays
The angel comes again
Manoah: "Now when your words come true, what is to be the child's manner of life?"
The angel repeats the instructions
Manoah: "Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat"
The angel: "I will not eat; prepare a burnt offering to the Lord"
"For Manoah did not know he was the angel"
Manoah: "What is your name?"
The angel: "Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful?"
Manoah takes the goat and the grain offering
He offers it on the rock to the Lord
The angel does wonders
When the flame goes up toward heaven
The angel ascends in the flame
Manoah and his wife fall on their faces
The angel appears no more
"We shall surely die, for we have seen God"
His wife: "If the Lord had meant to kill us"
"He would not have accepted a burnt offering"
The woman bears a son
She calls his name Samson
The child grows
The Lord blesses him
The Spirit of the Lord begins to stir him
Samson goes to Timnah
He sees a Philistine woman
"Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes"
His parents: "Is there not a woman among your relatives?"
"Must you take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?"
"Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes"
"His father and mother did not know it was from the Lord"
"For he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines"
Samson goes down to Timnah
A young lion roars against him
Spirit of the Lord rushes upon him
He tears the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat
"He had nothing in his hand"
He does not tell his father or mother
Later, he turns aside to see the carcass
A swarm of bees and honey in the body
He scrapes honey into his hands
He eats as he goes
He gives some to his parents
He does not tell them
His father goes down to the woman
Samson makes a feast
Thirty companions given to him
Samson's riddle: "Out of the eater came something to eat"
"Out of the strong came something sweet"
Three days; they cannot solve it
Seventh day: they say to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband"
"Lest we burn you and your father's house"
"Have you invited us here to impoverish us?"
Samson's wife weeps before him
"You only hate me; you do not love me"
Seven days of the feast she weeps
On the seventh day he tells her
She tells her people
Seventh day, before the sun sets
"What is sweeter than honey?"
"What is stronger than a lion?"
"If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle"
Spirit of the Lord rushes upon him
He goes down to Ashkelon
He strikes down thirty men
He takes their spoil
He gives the garments to those who had told the riddle
His anger burns
He goes up to his father's house
His wife is given to his companion

Her father: "I gave her to your companion"
"Is not her younger sister more beautiful?"
Samson: "This time I shall be innocent regarding the Philistines when I do them harm"
He catches 300 foxes
He takes torches
He ties the foxes tail to tail
He puts a torch between each pair of tails
He lets them go into the standing grain
He burns up the shocks, the standing grain, the olive orchards
Philistines: "Who has done this?"
"Samson, because his father-in-law gave his wife to his companion"
Philistines go up and burn her and her father
Samson: "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged"
He strikes them hip and thigh with a great blow
He goes down and stays in the cleft of the rock of Etam
Philistines encamp in Judah
They spread out against Lehi
Men of Judah: "Why have you come up against us?"
"We have come to bind Samson"
3,000 men of Judah go to the rock
"Do you not know the Philistines rule over us?"
"What have you done to us?"
Samson: "As they did to me, so have I done to them"
"We have come to bind you and give you into their hands"
Samson: "Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves"
They bind him with two new ropes
They bring him up from the rock
He comes to Lehi
Philistines shout
Spirit of the Lord rushes upon him
Ropes on his arms become as flax burned with fire
Bonds melt off his hands
He finds a fresh jawbone of a donkey
He reaches out and takes it
He strikes 1,000 men with it
"With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps"
"With the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men"
He throws away the jawbone
Ramath-lehi: "Hill of the Jawbone"
He is very thirsty
He calls upon the Lord
"You have given this great salvation"
"Shall I now die of thirst?"
God splits open the hollow place at Lehi
Water comes out
He drinks, his spirit returns
En-hakkore: "Spring of the One Who Called"
He judges Israel twenty years
Samson goes to Gaza
He sees a prostitute
He goes in to her
Gazites are told, "Samson has come here"
They surround the place
They lie in wait all night at the gate
"As soon as the light of the morning comes, we will kill him"
Samson lies till midnight
At midnight he arises
He takes hold of the doors of the city gate
He pulls them up, bar and all
He puts them on his shoulders
He carries them to the top of the hill at Hebron
Samson loves a woman in the Valley of Sorek
Her name is Delilah
Lords of the Philistines come to her
"Entice him, and see where his great strength lies"
"That we may bind him and subdue him"
"We will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver"
Delilah: "Please tell me where your great strength lies"
"And how you might be bound"
Samson: "If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings"
"I shall become weak and be like any other man"
Lords bring seven fresh bowstrings
She binds him
Men lie in ambush in an inner chamber
"The Philistines are upon you, Samson!"
He snaps the bowstrings as a thread snaps
His strength is not known
Delilah: "You have mocked me and told me lies"
"Please tell me how you might be bound"
Samson: "If they bind me with new ropes"
She takes new ropes and binds him
"The Philistines are upon you!"
He snaps the ropes off his arms like a thread
Delilah: "Until now you have mocked me"
"Tell me how you might be bound"
Samson: "If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web"
She weaves it tight with the pin
"The Philistines are upon you!"
He awakes and pulls away the pin, the loom, and the web
"How can you say, 'I love you,' when your heart is not with me?"
"You have mocked me these three times"
She presses him hard day after day
His soul is vexed to death
He tells her all his heart
"A razor has never come upon my head"
"For I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb"
"If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me"
Delilah sees he has told her all his heart
She sends word to the lords
"Come up again, for he has told me all his heart"
Lords come up with the money
She makes him sleep on her knees
She calls a man
He shaves off the seven locks
She begins to torment him
His strength leaves him
"The Philistines are upon you!"
He awakes: "I will go out as at other times and shake myself free"
"He did not know that the Lord had left him"
Philistines seize him
They gouge out his eyes
They bring him down to Gaza
They bind him with bronze shackles
He grinds at the mill in the prison
"But the hair of his head began to grow again"
Lords gather to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon
"Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand"
They praise their god
Their hearts are merry
"Call Samson, that he may entertain us"
They call Samson from prison
He entertains them
They make him stand between the pillars
About 3,000 men and women on the roof
Samson says to the boy who holds his hand
"Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests"
Samson calls to the Lord
"O Lord God, please remember me"
"Please strengthen me only this once, O God"
"That I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes"
He grasps the two middle pillars
One with his right hand, one with his left
"Let me die with the Philistines"
He bows with all his strength
The house falls upon the lords
The house falls upon all the people
"The dead whom he killed at his death were more than those he had killed during his life"
His brothers and all his family come down
They take him and bury him between Zorah and Eshtaol
He has judged Israel twenty years
Micah and the Levite
Micah makes an ephod and household gods
A Levite sojourns with him
"You shall be to me a father and a priest"
Five Danites spy out the land
They come to Micah's house
They recognize the voice of the Levite
They take Micah's idol and the ephod
600 Danites come with weapons
The Levite goes with them
Micah and his neighbors pursue
"What is the matter with you?"
"You take away my gods and my priest and go away"
"What have I left?"
Danites: "Do not let your voice be heard"
"Lest angry fellows fall upon you"
Micah sees they are too strong
He turns and goes home
Danites set up Micah's carved image
Laish captured and burned
They rebuild the city and dwell there
Levite and his concubine
The Levite takes a concubine from Bethlehem
She is unfaithful
She goes away to her father's house
Four months
Her husband goes after her to speak kindly
Her father makes him stay
Fifth day: they set out late
They pass by Jebus
The servant: "Let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites"
The Levite: "We will not turn aside into a foreign city"
"We will pass on to Gibeah"
They come to Gibeah of Benjamin
They sit down in the open square
No one takes them into his house
An old man from the hill country of Ephraim
"Where are you going, and where do you come from?"
The Levite tells his journey
The old man: "Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants"
"Only, do not spend the night in the square"
He brings them into his house
They are making their hearts merry
Worthless fellows surround the house
They pound on the door
"Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him"
Old man goes out to them
"No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly"
"Do not do this vile thing"
"Here are my virgin daughter and his concubine"
"Let me bring them out now"
"Violate them and do with them what seems good to you"
"But against this man do not do this outrageous thing"
Men will not listen
The man seizes his concubine
He puts her out to them
They know her and abuse her all night
At dawn they let her go
As morning appears, the woman comes back
She falls down at the door
She lies there until it is light
Her master rises in the morning
He opens the doors to go out
There is his concubine, fallen at the door
Her hands on the threshold
"Get up, let us be going"
There is no answer
He puts her on the donkey
He goes to his home
He takes a knife
He lays hold of his concubine
He divides her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces
He sends her throughout all the territory of Israel
"Such a thing has never happened since the day the Israelites came up"
All Israel assembles at Mizpah
400,000 men on foot who draw the sword
Benjaminites hear that Israel has come up
Israel: "Tell us, how did this evil happen?"
The Levite recounts the events
"I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces"
"They have committed abomination and outrage in Israel"
"Give your advice and counsel"
All the people arise as one
"We will not any of us go to his tent"
"We will go up against Gibeah by lot"
Tribes send men through Benjamin
"What evil is this that has taken place?"
"Give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah"
"That we may put them to death"
"That we may purge evil from Israel"
Benjaminites will not listen
Benjaminites gather from the cities to Gibeah
26,000 men who draw the sword
700 chosen men from Gibeah
"Every one could sling a stone and not miss"
Israel has 400,000 men who draw the sword
Israel goes to Bethel
"Who shall go up first to fight?"
The Lord: "Judah shall go up first"

"Shall I go out once more to fight?"
The Lord: "Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand"
Israel sets men in ambush
Third day: Israel draws up against Gibeah
Benjamin comes out
They are drawn away from the city
They begin to strike and kill
About thirty men of Israel fall
"We are defeating them as before"
Israel: "Let us flee and draw them away"
All the men of Israel rise from their place
Israel turns and forms a line
Men in ambush rush upon Gibeah
They strike all the city with the sword
Smoke of the city goes up to heaven
Men of Israel turn
Men of Benjamin are dismayed
"They saw that disaster was close upon them"
They flee toward the wilderness
The battle overtakes them
Those who came out of the cities are destroyed
Israel surrounds Benjamin
They pursue them and tread them down
18,000 men of Benjamin fall
"All of them men of valor"
They turn and flee toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon

"All of them men of valor"
600 men turn and flee to the rock of Rimmon
They remain four months
Israel turns back against the people of Benjamin
They strike them with the sword
Men, beasts, all that is found
"Also all the towns that they found they set on fire"
The men of Israel have sworn at Mizpah
"No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin"
The people come to Bethel
They sit there until evening before God
They weep bitterly
"O Lord, God of Israel, why has this happened?"
"That today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel?"
Next day: they build an altar
They offer burnt offerings and peace offerings
"Which of all the tribes did not come up to the Lord?"
"For they had taken a great oath concerning anyone who did not come up"
"He shall surely be put to death"
They have compassion on Benjamin
"How shall we provide wives for those who are left?"
"Since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin?"
"There must be an inheritance for the survivors"
"That a tribe not be blotted out from Israel"
"Yet we cannot give them wives of our daughters"
"Who is there that did not come up to Mizpah?"
"It was found that none of Jabesh-gilead had come"
12,000 of the bravest men sent
"Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword"
"Also the women and the little ones"
"Every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction"
They find 400 young virgins
"Who had not known a man by lying with him"
They bring them to the camp at Shiloh
The congregation sends word of peace to Benjamin at the rock of Rimmon
Benjamin returns
They give them the women of Jabesh-gilead
"But they were not enough"
"What shall we do for wives for those who are left?"
"Behold, there is the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh"
They command the people of Benjamin
"Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards"
"When the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance"
"Each of you catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh"
People of Benjamin do so
They catch their wives
They return to their inheritance
They rebuild the towns and dwell in them
The people of Israel depart
Each to his tribe and family
Each to his inheritance
"In those days there was no king in Israel"
"Everyone did what was right in his own eyes"
PART EIGHT: THE ANOINTED AND THE MADFrom Ruth's gleaning to David's throne, through Saul's torment and Jonathan's death: the pattern of kingship as divine madness, where the chosen become the cursed, and every coronation promises eventual corpses.

She kisses them
They weep aloud
"No, we will return with you"
Naomi: "Turn back, my daughters"

"Your God my God"
"Where you die I will die"
"May the Lord do so to me and more if anything but death parts me from you"
They come to Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest
The whole town is stirred
"Is this Naomi?"
"Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara"
"For the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me"
"I went away full, and the Lord has brought me back empty"
Ruth goes to glean in the field
She happens to come to the part belonging to Boaz
Boaz comes from Bethlehem
"The Lord be with you"
Reapers: "The Lord bless you"
Boaz notices Ruth
"Whose young woman is this?"
"She is the young Moabite woman"
Boaz speaks to Ruth
"Do not go to glean in another field"
"Keep close to my young women"
Ruth falls on her face
"Why have I found favor in your eyes?"
"I am a foreigner"
Boaz: "All that you have done for your mother-in-law has been fully told to me"
"The Lord repay you for what you have done"
"A full reward be given you by the Lord"
"Under whose wings you have come to take refuge"
At mealtime: "Come here and eat"
She sits beside the reapers
He passes her roasted grain
She eats and is satisfied
She has some left over
Boaz instructs his young men
"Let her glean even among the sheaves"
"Pull out some from the bundles for her"
She gleans until evening
She beats out what she has gleaned
About an ephah of barley
She brings it to Naomi
Naomi: "Where did you glean today?"
"Blessed be the man who took notice of you"
"The man's name is Boaz"
Naomi: "May he be blessed by the Lord"
"The man is a close relative of ours, one of our redeemers"
Ruth gleans in his field until the end of barley and wheat harvest
Naomi: "Should I not seek rest for you?"
"Is not Boaz our relative?"
"He will be winnowing barley tonight at the threshing floor"
"Wash and anoint yourself"
"Put on your cloak"
"When he lies down, observe the place"
"Then go and uncover his feet and lie down"
Ruth: "All that you say I will do"
She goes down to the threshing floor
Boaz eats and drinks
His heart is merry
He goes to lie down at the end of the heap of grain
She comes softly
She uncovers his feet
She lies down
At midnight the man is startled
He turns over
A woman is lying at his feet
"Who are you?"
"I am Ruth, your servant"
"Spread your wings over your servant"
"For you are a redeemer"
Boaz: "May you be blessed by the Lord"
"You have made this last kindness greater than the first"
"You have not gone after young men"
"Do not fear"
"I will do for you all that you ask"
"All my fellow townsmen know you are a worthy woman"
"Now it is true that I am a redeemer"
"Yet there is a redeemer nearer than I"
"Remain tonight"
"In the morning, if he will redeem you, good"
"But if he is not willing, as the Lord lives, I will redeem you"
She lies at his feet until the morning
She rises before one could recognize another
Boaz: "Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing floor"
He measures out six measures of barley
He loads it on her
She goes into the city
Naomi: "How did you fare, my daughter?"
Ruth tells her all
"He gave me these six measures"
"He said, 'You must not go back empty-handed to your mother-in-law'"
Naomi: "Wait until you learn how the matter turns out"
"The man will not rest but will settle the matter today"
Boaz goes up to the gate
He sits down there
The redeemer passes by
"Turn aside, friend; sit down here"
He turns aside and sits down
Boaz takes ten men of the elders
"Sit down here"
They sit down
Boaz speaks to the redeemer
"Naomi is selling the parcel of land that belonged to Elimelech"
"If you will redeem it, redeem it"
"But if you will not, tell me, that I may know"
"For there is no one besides you to redeem it"
"And I come after you"
The redeemer: "I will redeem it"
Boaz: "The day you buy the field from Naomi"
"You also acquire Ruth the Moabite"
"In order to perpetuate the name of the dead in his inheritance"
"Then I cannot redeem it"
"Lest I impair my own inheritance"
"Take my right of redemption yourself"
"For I cannot redeem it"
The custom of drawing off the sandal
The man draws off his sandal
Boaz to the elders: "You are witnesses"
"I have bought all that was Elimelech's"
"Also Ruth the Moabite I have bought to be my wife"
Elders and all the people: "We are witnesses"
"May the Lord make the woman like Rachel and Leah"
"May you act worthily in Ephrathah"
Boaz takes Ruth
She becomes his wife
He goes in to her
The Lord gives her conception
She bears a son
Women say to Naomi: "Blessed be the Lord"
"Who has not left you without a redeemer"
"May his name be renowned in Israel"
"He shall be to you a restorer of life"
Naomi takes the child
She lays him on her lap
She becomes his nurse
Women: "A son has been born to Naomi"
They name him Obed
Obed, father of Jesse
Jesse, father of David
Elkanah has two wives
Hannah and Peninnah
Peninnah has children
Hannah has no children
Elkanah goes up year by year to worship at Shiloh
Hophni and Phinehas, priests of the Lord, are there
When the day comes, Elkanah offers sacrifice
He gives portions to Peninnah and her children
To Hannah he gives a double portion
"Because he loved her"
"Though the Lord had closed her womb"
Her rival used to provoke her grievously
"To irritate her, because the Lord had closed her womb"
So it went on year by year
Whenever she went up to the house of the Lord
"She used to provoke her"
Hannah weeps and will not eat
Elkanah: "Hannah, why do you weep?"
"Why do you not eat?"
"Why is your heart sad?"
"Am I not more to you than ten sons?"
Hannah rises after they have eaten and drunk
Eli the priest is sitting on the seat beside the doorpost
Hannah is deeply distressed
She prays to the Lord
She weeps bitterly
She vows a vow
"O Lord of hosts, if you will look on the affliction of your servant"
"And remember me and not forget your servant"
"But will give to your servant a son"
"Then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life"
"And no razor shall touch his head"
She continues praying before the Lord
Eli observes her mouth
Hannah is speaking in her heart
Only her lips move
Her voice is not heard
Eli thinks she is drunk
"How long will you go on being drunk?"
"Put your wine away from you"
Hannah: "No, my lord"
"I am a woman troubled in spirit"
"I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink"
"I have been pouring out my soul before the Lord"
"Do not regard your servant as a worthless woman"
"All along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation"
Eli: "Go in peace"
"The God of Israel grant your petition"
"Let your servant find favor in your eyes"
She goes her way and eats
Her face is no longer sad
They rise early and worship
They return to their house at Ramah
Elkanah knows Hannah
The Lord remembers her
In due time Hannah conceives
She bears a son
She calls his name Samuel
"For I have asked for him from the Lord"
Elkanah goes up with all his house to offer sacrifice
Hannah does not go up
"As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him"
"That he may appear in the presence of the Lord"
"And dwell there forever"
Elkanah: "Do what seems best to you"
"Only, may the Lord establish his word"
The woman remains and nurses her son
Until she weans him
When she has weaned him, she takes him up
A three-year-old bull
An ephah of flour
A skin of wine
She brings him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh
The child is young
They slaughter the bull
They bring the child to Eli
"Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord"
"I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying"
"For this child I prayed"
"The Lord has granted my petition"
"Therefore I have lent him to the Lord"
"As long as he lives, he is lent to the Lord"
They worship the Lord there
Hannah's prayer
"My heart exults in the Lord"
"My horn is exalted in the Lord"
"There is none holy like the Lord"
"There is no rock like our God"
"The bows of the mighty are broken"
"But the feeble bind on strength"
"Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread"
"But those who were hungry have ceased to hunger"
"The barren has borne seven"
"But she who has many children is forlorn"
"The Lord kills and brings to life"
"He brings down to Sheol and raises up"
"The Lord makes poor and makes rich"
"He brings low and he exalts"
"He raises up the poor from the dust"
"He lifts the needy from the ash heap"
Elkanah returns home to Ramah
The boy ministers to the Lord in the presence of Eli
The sons of Eli are worthless men
They do not know the Lord
The custom of the priests with the people
When any man offered sacrifice
The priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork
He would thrust it into the pan or kettle
"All that the fork brought up the priest would take"
This is what they did at Shiloh
Before the fat was burned
The priest's servant would come
"Give meat for the priest to roast"
"He will not accept boiled meat from you but only raw"
If the man said, "Let them burn the fat first"
"Then take as much as you wish"
He would say, "No, you must give it now"
"If not, I will take it by force"
The sin of the young men was very great
"For the men treated the offering of the Lord with contempt"
Samuel ministers before the Lord
A boy clothed with a linen ephod
His mother makes him a little robe
She takes it to him each year
When she comes up with her husband to offer the sacrifice
Eli blesses Elkanah and his wife
"May the Lord give you children by this woman"
"For the petition she asked of the Lord"
They return to their home
The Lord visits Hannah
She conceives and bears three sons and two daughters
The boy Samuel grows in the presence of the Lord
Eli is very old
He hears all his sons are doing to Israel
"How they lie with the women who serve at the entrance"
"Why do you do such things?"
"I hear of your evil dealings from all these people"
"No, my sons; it is no good report"
"If someone sins against a man, God will mediate"
"But if someone sins against the Lord, who can intercede?"
They do not listen to their father
"For it was the will of the Lord to put them to death"
Samuel continues to grow in stature and in favor
A man of God comes to Eli
"Thus says the Lord: Did I indeed reveal myself to your father's house?"
"Did I choose him out of all the tribes to be my priest?"
"Why then do you scorn my sacrifices?"
"Why do you honor your sons above me?"
"Therefore the Lord declares: Far be it from me"
"For those who honor me I will honor"
"Those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed"
"Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength"
"I will raise up for myself a faithful priest"
"Everyone who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver"
"This that shall come upon your two sons shall be the sign"
"They shall both die on the same day"
Samuel ministers to the Lord under Eli
The word of the Lord is rare in those days
There is no frequent vision
Eli is lying down in his own place
His eyes have begun to grow dim
He cannot see
The lamp of God has not yet gone out
Samuel is lying down in the temple
Where the ark of God is
The Lord calls: "Samuel! Samuel!"
"Here I am"
He runs to Eli
"Here I am, for you called me"
"I did not call; lie down again"
He goes and lies down
The Lord calls again: "Samuel!"
Samuel goes to Eli
"Here I am, for you called me"
"I did not call, my son; lie down again"
"Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord"
"The word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him"
The Lord calls Samuel the third time
He gets up and goes to Eli
"Here I am, for you called me"
Eli perceives the Lord is calling the boy
"Go, lie down, and if he calls you, you shall say"
"'Speak, Lord, for your servant hears'"
Samuel goes and lies down
The Lord comes and stands
Calling as at other times: "Samuel! Samuel!"
"Speak, for your servant hears"
The Lord says to Samuel
"Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel"
"At which the two ears of everyone who hears will tingle"
"I declare against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house"
"From beginning to end"
"I declare to him that I am about to punish his house forever"
"For the iniquity that he knew"
"Because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them"
"I swear to the house of Eli"
"The iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever"
Samuel lies until morning
He opens the doors of the house of the Lord
Samuel is afraid to tell the vision to Eli
Eli calls Samuel
"What was it he told you?"
"Do not hide it from me"
"May God do so to you and more also if you hide anything"
Samuel tells him everything
He hides nothing
"It is the Lord"
"Let him do what seems good to him"
Samuel grows
The Lord is with him
He lets none of his words fall to the ground
All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knows Samuel is established as a prophet
The Lord continues to appear at Shiloh
The word of Samuel comes to all Israel
Israel goes out to battle against the Philistines
They encamp beside Ebenezer
The Philistines encamp at Aphek
The Philistines draw up in line against Israel
The battle spreads
Israel is defeated
About 4,000 men fall
The people come to the camp
Elders of Israel: "Why has the Lord defeated us today?"
"Let us bring the ark of the covenant"
"That it may come among us and save us"
They send to Shiloh
They bring from there the ark of the covenant
The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, are with the ark
When the ark comes into the camp
All Israel gives a mighty shout
The earth resounds
Philistines hear the sound of the shouting
"What does this great shouting mean?"
They learn the ark has come
The Philistines are afraid
"A god has come into the camp"
"Woe to us! Who can deliver us from these mighty gods?"
"These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every sort of plague"
"Take courage, and be men, O Philistines"
"Lest you become slaves to the Hebrews"
"Fight"
The Philistines fight
Israel is defeated
Every man flees to his home
Very great slaughter
30,000 foot soldiers of Israel fall
The ark of God is captured
The two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, die
A man of Benjamin runs from the battle line
He comes to Shiloh the same day
His clothes torn and earth on his head
Eli is sitting on his seat by the road watching
"For his heart trembles for the ark"
The man comes into the city and tells the news
All the city cries out
Eli hears the sound of the outcry
"What is this uproar?"
The man hurries and tells Eli
Eli is ninety-eight years old
His eyes are set so that he cannot see
The man says to Eli
"I am he who has come from the battle"
"I fled from the battle today"
"How did it go, my son?"
"Israel has fled before the Philistines"
"There has been a great defeat among the people"
"Your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead"
"The ark of God has been captured"
When he mentions the ark
Eli falls over backward from his seat by the side of the gate
His neck is broken
He dies
"For the man was old and heavy"
He has judged Israel forty years
His daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, is pregnant
About to give birth
When she hears the news
That the ark is captured
That her father-in-law and her husband are dead
She bows and gives birth
"For her pains come upon her"
About the time of her death the women attending her say
"Do not be afraid, for you have borne a son"
She does not answer or pay attention
She names the child Ichabod
"The glory has departed from Israel"
"Because the ark of God has been captured"
"And because of her father-in-law and her husband"
"The glory has departed from Israel"
"For the ark of God has been captured"
The Philistines capture the ark
They bring it from Ebenezer to Ashdod
They bring it into the house of Dagon
They set it up beside Dagon
When the people of Ashdod rise early the next day
Dagon has fallen face downward before the ark
They take Dagon and put him back
Next morning: Dagon has fallen face downward again
The head of Dagon and both his hands are lying cut off
Only the trunk of Dagon is left
The hand of the Lord is heavy against the people of Ashdod
He terrifies and afflicts them with tumors
Ashdod and its territory
The men of Ashdod see what is happening
"The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us"
"For his hand is hard against us and against Dagon"
They send and gather all the lords of the Philistines
"What shall we do with the ark?"
"Let the ark be brought around to Gath"
They bring it to Gath
The hand of the Lord is against the city
Very great panic
He afflicts the men with tumors, both young and old
They send the ark to Ekron
As it comes to Ekron
The people cry out
"They have brought around the ark to us, to kill us and our people"
They send and gather all the lords
"Send away the ark of the God of Israel"
"Let it return to its own place"
"That it may not kill us and our people"
There is a deathly panic
The hand of God is very heavy there
The men who do not die are stricken with tumors
The cry of the city goes up to heaven
The ark is in the country of the Philistines seven months
The Philistines call for the priests and diviners
"What shall we do with the ark?"
"Tell us how we should send it to its place"
"Do not send it empty"
"By all means return him a guilt offering"
"Then you will be healed"
"What is the guilt offering we shall return?"
"Five golden tumors and five golden mice"
"According to the number of the lords of the Philistines"
"For the same plague was on all of you"
"Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians hardened their hearts?"
"Now then, take and prepare a new cart"
"And two milk cows on which there has never come a yoke"
"Yoke the cows to the cart"
"But take their calves home, away from them"
"Take the ark and place it on the cart"
"Put in a box at its side the figures of gold"
"Send it off and let it go its way"
"And watch. If it goes up on the way to its own land"
"Then it is he who has done us this great harm"
"But if not, then we shall know it is not his hand that struck us"
"It happened to us by coincidence"
The men do so
They take two milk cows
They yoke them to the cart
They shut up their calves at home
They put the ark on the cart
The box with the golden mice and images of tumors
The cows go straight toward Beth-shemesh
They go along the highway, lowing as they go
They turn neither to the right nor to the left
Lords of the Philistines follow them
As far as the border of Beth-shemesh
People of Beth-shemesh are reaping wheat harvest
They lift up their eyes
They see the ark
They rejoice to see it
The cart comes into the field of Joshua
It stops there
A great stone is there
They split up the wood of the cart
They offer the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord
The Levites take down the ark
They take down the box
They set them upon the great stone
Men of Beth-shemesh offer burnt offerings
They sacrifice sacrifices to the Lord
The five lords of the Philistines see it
They return to Ekron
These are the golden tumors the Philistines return
One for each of the cities of the Philistines
The golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
The great stone beside which they set down the ark
"Is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua"
The Lord strikes some of the men of Beth-shemesh
"Because they looked upon the ark"
He strikes seventy men
The people mourn
"Because the Lord had struck the people with a great blow"
Men of Beth-shemesh: "Who is able to stand before the Lord, this holy God?"
"To whom shall he go up away from us?"
They send messengers to Kiriath-jearim
"The Philistines have returned the ark"
"Come down and take it up to you"
The men of Kiriath-jearim come
They bring up the ark
They bring it to the house of Abinadab on the hill
They consecrate Eleazar to have charge of the ark
From the day the ark lodges at Kiriath-jearim
A long time passes
Twenty years
All the house of Israel laments after the Lord
Samuel says to Israel
"If you are returning to the Lord with all your heart"
"Put away the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth"
"Direct your heart to the Lord and serve him only"
"He will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines"
People of Israel put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth
They serve the Lord only
Samuel: "Gather all Israel at Mizpah"
"I will pray to the Lord for you"
They gather at Mizpah
They draw water and pour it out before the Lord
They fast that day
"We have sinned against the Lord"
Samuel judges Israel at Mizpah
Philistines hear Israel has gathered
Lords of the Philistines go up against Israel
People of Israel hear and are afraid
"Do not cease to cry out to the Lord for us"
"That he may save us from the hand of the Philistines"
Samuel takes a nursing lamb
He offers it as a whole burnt offering
He cries out to the Lord
The Lord answers him
As Samuel is offering up the burnt offering
The Philistines draw near
The Lord thunders with a mighty sound
He throws them into confusion
They are routed before Israel
Men of Israel go out from Mizpah
They pursue the Philistines
They strike them down
Samuel takes a stone
He sets it up between Mizpah and Shen
He calls its name Ebenezer
"For he said, 'Till now the Lord has helped us'"
Philistines are subdued
They do not again enter the territory of Israel
The hand of the Lord is against the Philistines all the days of Samuel
Cities the Philistines had taken are restored
There is peace between Israel and the Amorites
Samuel judges Israel all the days of his life
He goes on a circuit year by year
Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah
He judges Israel in all these places
He returns to Ramah
His home is there
He judges Israel there
He builds an altar to the Lord
Samuel grows old
He makes his sons judges over Israel
Name of his firstborn son: Joel
Name of his second: Abijah
They are judges in Beersheba
His sons do not walk in his ways
They turn aside after gain
They take bribes
They pervert justice
All the elders of Israel gather
They come to Samuel at Ramah
"Behold, you are old"
"Your sons do not walk in your ways"
"Appoint for us a king to judge us like all the nations"
It displeases Samuel
"When they said, 'Give us a king to judge us'"
Samuel prays to the Lord
The Lord says to Samuel
"Obey the voice of the people in all that they say"
"For they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me"
"From being king over them"
"According to all the deeds they have done"
"From the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this day"
"Forsaking me and serving other gods"
"So they are also doing to you"
"Obey their voice"
"Only you shall solemnly warn them"
"Show them the ways of the king who shall reign over them"
Samuel tells the people the words of the Lord
"These will be the ways of the king"
"He will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots"
"He will appoint for himself commanders"
"Some to plow his ground and reap his harvest"
"To make his implements of war"
"He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers"
"He will take the best of your fields and vineyards"
"He will give them to his servants"
"He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards"
"He will take your male servants and female servants"
"The best of your young men and your donkeys"
"He will take the tenth of your flocks"
"You shall be his slaves"
"In that day you will cry out because of your king"
"But the Lord will not answer you in that day"
The people refuse to obey Samuel
"No! But there shall be a king over us"
"That we also may be like all the nations"
"That our king may judge us"
"And go out before us and fight our battles"
Samuel hears all the words of the people
He repeats them in the ears of the Lord
The Lord: "Obey their voice and make them a king"
Samuel: "Go every man to his city"
There is a man of Benjamin
His name is Kish
A mighty man of valor
He has a son
His name is Saul
A handsome young man
There is not a man among the people more handsome
From his shoulders upward he is taller than any of the people
The donkeys of Kish are lost
Kish says to Saul: "Take one of the young men"
"Arise, go and look for the donkeys"
They pass through the hill country of Ephraim
They pass through the land of Shalishah
They do not find them
They pass through the land of Shaalim
They are not there
They pass through the land of Benjamin
They do not find them
They come to the land of Zuph
Saul says to his servant
"Come, let us go back"
"Lest my father cease to care about the donkeys and become anxious"
The servant: "Behold, there is a man of God in this city"
"All that he says comes true"
"Perhaps he can tell us the way we should go"
"What can we bring the man?"
"The bread in our sacks is gone"
"There is no present to bring"
The servant: "Here, I have with me a quarter of a shekel of silver"
"I will give it to the man of God to tell us our way"
"He who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer"
"Come, let us go to the seer"
As they go up the hill to the city
They meet young women coming out to draw water
"Is the seer here?"
"He is; behold, he is just ahead of you"
"Hurry now, for he has come today to the city"
"Because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place"
They go up to the city
As they enter the city, they meet Samuel coming out
The day before Saul came
The Lord had revealed to Samuel
"Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from Benjamin"
"You shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel"
"He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines"
"For I have seen my people"
"Because their cry has come to me"
When Samuel sees Saul
The Lord tells him
"Here is the man of whom I spoke"
"He it is who shall restrain my people"
Saul approaches Samuel in the gate
"Tell me where is the house of the seer"
Samuel: "I am the seer"
"Go up before me to the high place"
"You shall eat with me today"
"In the morning I will let you go"
"I will tell you all that is on your mind"
"As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago"
"Do not set your mind on them, for they have been found"
"For whom is all that is desirable in Israel?"
"Is it not for you and for all your father's house?"
Saul: "Am I not a Benjaminite?"
"From the least of the tribes of Israel?"
"Is not my clan the humblest of all the clans?"
"Why then have you spoken to me in this way?"
Samuel takes Saul and his young man
He brings them into the hall
He gives them a place at the head of those invited
About thirty persons
Samuel says to the cook
"Bring the portion I gave you"
The cook takes up the leg and what was on it
He sets it before Saul
Samuel: "See, what was kept is set before you"
"Eat, because it was kept for you until the hour appointed"
Saul eats with Samuel that day
They come down from the high place
He speaks with Saul on the roof
They arise early
About the break of dawn
Samuel calls to Saul on the roof
"Up, that I may send you on your way"
Saul arose
Both he and Samuel go out into the street
As they are going down to the outskirts of the city
Samuel: "Tell the servant to pass on before us"
"But you, stand here a while"
"That I may make known to you the word of God"
Samuel takes a flask of oil
He pours it on Saul's head
He kisses him
"Has not the Lord anointed you to be prince over his people Israel?"
"You shall reign over the people of the Lord"
"You will save them from the hand of their surrounding enemies"
"This shall be the sign to you that the Lord has anointed you"
Samuel tells him the signs
"When you depart from me today"
"You will meet two men by Rachel's tomb"
"They will say to you, 'The donkeys have been found'"
"Then you shall go on from there"
"You will come to the oak of Tabor"
"Three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you"
"One carrying three young goats, another three loaves, another a skin of wine"
"They will greet you and give you two loaves"
"You shall accept them"
"After that you shall come to Gibeath-elohim"
"Where there is a garrison of the Philistines"
"When you come to the city"
"You will meet a group of prophets"
"Prophesying, with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them"
"Then the Spirit of the Lord will rush upon you"
"You will prophesy with them"
"You will be turned into another man"
"When these signs meet you"
"Do what your hand finds to do"
"For God is with you"
"Go down before me to Gilgal"
"I am coming down to you to offer burnt offerings"
"Seven days you shall wait"
"Until I come to you and show you what you shall do"
When Saul turns his back to leave Samuel
God gives him another heart
All these signs come to pass that day
When they come to Gibeah
A group of prophets meets him
The Spirit of God rushes upon him
He prophesies among them
All who knew him previously see him prophesying
"What has come over the son of Kish?"
"Is Saul also among the prophets?"
A man of the place answers
"And who is their father?"
"Is Saul also among the prophets?" becomes a proverb
He finishes prophesying
He comes to the high place
Saul's uncle: "Where did you go?"
"To seek the donkeys"
"When we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel"
"Please tell me what Samuel said"
Saul: "He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found"
"But about the matter of the kingdom"
"He did not tell him anything"
Samuel summons the people to the Lord at Mizpah
He says to the people of Israel
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"I brought up Israel out of Egypt"
"I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians"
"From the hand of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you"
"But today you have rejected your God"
"Who saves you from all your calamities and distresses"
"You have said to him, 'Set a king over us'"
"Now present yourselves before the Lord"
"By your tribes and by your thousands"
Samuel brings all the tribes near
The tribe of Benjamin is taken by lot
He brings the tribe of Benjamin near by its clans
The clan of the Matrites is taken
Saul the son of Kish is taken
They seek him, but he cannot be found
They inquire again of the Lord
"Is there a man still to come?"
The Lord: "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage"
They run and take him from there
When he stands among the people
He is taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward
Samuel: "Do you see him whom the Lord has chosen?"
"There is none like him among all the people"
All the people shout
"Long live the king!"
Samuel tells the people the rights and duties of the kingship
He writes them in a book
He lays it up before the Lord
Samuel sends all the people away
Each one to his home
Saul also goes to his home at Gibeah
Men of valor go with him
"Whose hearts God had touched"
Some worthless fellows: "How can this man save us?"
They despise him
They bring him no present
He holds his peace
Nahash the Ammonite goes up
He besieges Jabesh-gilead
All the men of Jabesh say to Nahash
"Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you"
Nahash: "On this condition I will make a treaty"
"That I gouge out all your right eyes"
"Thus put disgrace on all Israel"
Elders of Jabesh: "Give us seven days' respite"
"That we may send messengers through all Israel"
"If there is no one to save us, we will give ourselves up to you"
Messengers come to Gibeah of Saul
They tell the news in the ears of the people
All the people weep aloud
Saul is coming from the field behind the oxen
"What is wrong with the people, that they are weeping?"
They tell him the news of the men of Jabesh
The Spirit of God rushes upon Saul
His anger is greatly kindled
He takes a yoke of oxen
He cuts them in pieces
He sends them throughout Israel by messengers
"Whoever does not come out after Saul and Samuel"
"So shall it be done to his oxen!"
The dread of the Lord falls upon the people
They come out as one man
He musters them at Bezek
300,000 from Israel
30,000 from Judah
They say to the messengers
"Thus shall you say to the men of Jabesh-gilead"
"'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance'"
The messengers come and tell the men of Jabesh
They are glad
Men of Jabesh say to Nahash
"Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you"
"Then you may do to us whatever seems good to you"
The next day Saul puts the people in three companies
They come into the midst of the camp in the morning watch
They strike down the Ammonites until the heat of the day
Those who survive are scattered
"So that no two of them are left together"
The people say to Samuel
"Who is it that said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?'"
"Bring the men, that we may put them to death"
Saul: "Not a man shall be put to death this day"
"For today the Lord has worked salvation in Israel"
Samuel: "Come, let us go to Gilgal"
"And there renew the kingdom"
All the people go to Gilgal
They make Saul king before the Lord
They sacrifice peace offerings before the Lord
There Saul and all the men of Israel rejoice greatly
Samuel addresses all Israel
"Behold, I have obeyed your voice"
"I have made a king over you"
"Behold, the king walks before you"
"I am old and gray"
"My sons are with you"
"I have walked before you from my youth until this day"
"Here I am; testify against me"
"Whose ox have I taken?"
"Whose donkey have I taken?"
"Whom have I defrauded?"
"Whom have I oppressed?"
"From whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes?"
"Testify against me and I will restore it to you"
"You have not defrauded us or oppressed us"
"You have not taken anything from any man's hand"
"The Lord is witness against you"
"His anointed is witness this day"
"That you have not found anything in my hand"
"He is witness"
Samuel recounts Israel's history
"It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron"
"Who brought your fathers up out of Egypt"
"They forgot the Lord their God"
"He sold them into the hand of Sisera"
"Into the hand of the Philistines"
"Into the hand of the king of Moab"
"They cried to the Lord and said"
"'We have sinned, because we have forsaken the Lord'"
"'Deliver us out of the hand of our enemies'"
"The Lord sent Jerubbaal and Barak"
"Jephthah and Samuel, and delivered you"
"When you saw that Nahash was coming against you"
"You said to me, 'No, but a king shall reign over us'"
"When the Lord your God was your king"
"Behold, here is the king you have chosen"
"Behold, the Lord has set a king over you"
"If you will fear the Lord and serve him"
"And obey his voice"
"And not rebel against the commandment of the Lord"
"Then both you and the king will follow the Lord"
"But if you will not obey the voice of the Lord"
"Then the hand of the Lord will be against you and your king"
"Now therefore stand still and see this great thing"
"It is wheat harvest today"
"I will call upon the Lord"
"That he may send thunder and rain"
"You shall know and see that your wickedness is great"
"In asking for yourselves a king"
Samuel calls upon the Lord
The Lord sends thunder and rain that day
All the people greatly fear the Lord and Samuel
All the people say to Samuel
"Pray for your servants to the Lord your God"
"That we may not die"
"For we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask for ourselves a king"
Samuel: "Do not be afraid"
"You have done all this evil"
"Yet do not turn aside from following the Lord"
"Serve the Lord with all your heart"
"The Lord will not forsake his people"
"For his great name's sake"
"It has pleased the Lord to make you a people for himself"
"Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord"
"By ceasing to pray for you"
"I will instruct you in the good and the right way"
"Only fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart"
"For consider what great things he has done for you"
"But if you still do wickedly"
"You shall be swept away, both you and your king"
Saul is one year old when he begins to reign
When he has reigned two years over Israel
Saul chooses 3,000 men of Israel
2,000 with Saul at Michmash
1,000 with Jonathan at Gibeah
He sends the rest home
Jonathan defeats the garrison of the Philistines at Geba
The Philistines hear of it
Saul blows the trumpet throughout the land
"Let the Hebrews hear"
All Israel hears: "Saul has defeated the garrison"
"Also Israel has become a stench to the Philistines"
The people are called out to join Saul at Gilgal
Philistines gather to fight
30,000 chariots
6,000 horsemen
Troops like the sand on the seashore
They encamp at Michmash
When the men of Israel see they are in trouble
They hide in caves, holes, rocks, tombs, cisterns
Some Hebrews cross the Jordan to Gad and Gilead
Saul is still at Gilgal
All the people follow him trembling
He waits seven days
The time appointed by Samuel
But Samuel does not come to Gilgal
The people are scattering from him
Saul: "Bring the burnt offering and the peace offerings"
He offers the burnt offering
As soon as he finishes offering the burnt offering
Samuel arrives
Saul goes out to meet him and greet him
Samuel: "What have you done?"
Saul: "When I saw that the people were scattering"
"You did not come within the days appointed"
"The Philistines had mustered at Michmash"
"I said, 'Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal'"
"'I have not sought the favor of the Lord'"
"So I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering"
Samuel: "You have done foolishly"
"You have not kept the command of the Lord your God"
"If you had kept it, the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever"
"But now your kingdom shall not continue"
"The Lord has sought out a man after his own heart"
"The Lord has commanded him to be prince over his people"
"Because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you"
Samuel rises and goes
Saul goes up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin
Saul numbers the people present with him
About 600 men
Saul, Jonathan, and the people are staying in Geba
Philistines encamp at Michmash
Raiders come out of the camp in three companies
One company turns toward Ophrah
One toward Beth-horon
One toward the border that looks down on the Valley of Zeboim
There is no blacksmith in all the land of Israel
"For the Philistines said, 'Lest the Hebrews make swords or spears'"
Every one of the Israelites goes down to the Philistines
To sharpen his plowshare, mattock, axe, or sickle
On the day of the battle
There is neither sword nor spear in the hand of any of the people
Except for Saul and Jonathan
Garrison of the Philistines goes out to the pass of Michmash
Jonathan says to his armor-bearer
"Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised"
"It may be that the Lord will work for us"
"For nothing can hinder the Lord from saving by many or by few"
"Do all that is in your heart"
"I am with you heart and soul"
Jonathan: "We will cross over to the men"
"We will show ourselves to them"
"If they say, 'Wait until we come to you'"
"Then we will stand still"
"But if they say, 'Come up to us'"
"Then we will go up"
"For the Lord has given them into our hand"
"This shall be the sign to us"
They show themselves to the garrison
"Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes"
"Come up to us, and we will show you a thing"
Jonathan to his armor-bearer: "Come up after me"
"For the Lord has given them into the hand of Israel"
Jonathan climbs up on his hands and feet
His armor-bearer after him
They fall before Jonathan
His armor-bearer kills them after him
About twenty men in the first strike
There is a panic in the camp
In the field
Among all the people
The garrison and the raiders also tremble
The earth quakes
It becomes a very great panic
Watchmen of Saul look
The multitude is dispersing here and there
Saul: "Count and see who has gone from us"
They count
Jonathan and his armor-bearer are not there
Saul says to Ahijah: "Bring the ark of God here"
"For the ark was at that time with the people of Israel"
While Saul is talking to the priest
The tumult in the camp of the Philistines increases
Saul: "Withdraw your hand"
Saul and all the people rally
They go to the battle
Every Philistine's sword is against his fellow
Very great confusion
Hebrews who had been with the Philistines join Israel
Israelites who had hidden hear the Philistines are fleeing
They too follow hard after them
The Lord saves Israel that day
The battle passes beyond Beth-aven
Men of Israel are hard pressed that day
Saul has laid an oath on the people
"Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening"
"And I am avenged on my enemies"
None of the people tastes food
They all enter the forest
There is honey on the ground
When the people enter the forest
The honey is dropping
But no one puts his hand to his mouth
"For the people fear the oath"
Jonathan has not heard his father charge the people
He puts out the tip of the staff
He dips it in the honeycomb
He puts his hand to his mouth
His eyes become bright
One of the people: "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath"
"'Cursed be the man who eats food this day'"
"So the people are faint"
Jonathan: "My father has troubled the land"
"See how my eyes have become bright"
"Because I tasted a little of this honey"
"How much better if the people had eaten freely"
"Of the spoil of their enemies that they found"
"The defeat among the Philistines would have been much greater"
They strike down the Philistines
From Michmash to Aijalon
The people are very faint
They pounce on the spoil
They take sheep, oxen, and calves
They slaughter them on the ground
The people eat them with the blood
"Behold, the people are sinning against the Lord"
"By eating with the blood"
Saul: "You have dealt treacherously"
"Roll a great stone to me here"
"Disperse yourselves among the people"
"Say to them, 'Let every man bring his ox or his sheep'"
"'Slaughter them here and eat'"
"'Do not sin against the Lord by eating with the blood'"
Every man brings his ox that night
They slaughter them there
Saul builds an altar to the Lord
It is the first altar he built
Saul: "Let us go down after the Philistines by night"
"Let us plunder them until the morning light"
"Let us not leave a man of them"
"Do whatever seems good to you"
The priest: "Let us draw near to God here"
Saul inquires of God
"Shall I go down after the Philistines?"
"Will you give them into the hand of Israel?"
He does not answer him that day
Saul: "Come here, all you leaders of the people"
"Know and see how this sin has arisen today"
"As the Lord lives who saves Israel"
"Though it be in Jonathan my son"
"He shall surely die"
Not one of the people answers
He says to all Israel
"You shall be on one side"
"I and Jonathan my son will be on the other"
"Do what seems good to you"
Saul: "O Lord God of Israel"
"Why have you not answered your servant this day?"
"If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan"
"Give Urim"
"But if this guilt is in your people Israel"
"Give Thummim"
Jonathan and Saul are taken
The people are cleared
"Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan"
Jonathan is taken
Saul: "Tell me what you have done"
Jonathan: "I tasted a little honey"
"With the tip of the staff in my hand"
"Here I am; I will die"
Saul: "God do so to me and more also"
"You shall surely die, Jonathan"
The people say to Saul
"Shall Jonathan die"
"Who has worked this great salvation in Israel?"
"Far from it!"
"As the Lord lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall"
"For he has worked with God this day"
The people ransom Jonathan
He does not die
Saul goes up from pursuing the Philistines
The Philistines go to their own place
Saul takes the kingship over Israel
He fights against all his enemies on every side
Moab, Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, Philistines
Wherever he turns he puts them to the worse
He does valiantly
He strikes the Amalekites
He delivers Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them
The sons of Saul: Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua
His two daughters: Merab the firstborn, Michal the younger
Name of Saul's wife: Ahinoam
Name of the commander of his army: Abner
There is hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul
When Saul sees any strong man
Or any valiant man
He attaches him to himself
Samuel says to Saul
"The Lord sent me to anoint you king"
"Now listen to the words of the Lord"
"Thus says the Lord of hosts"
"I have noted what Amalek did to Israel"
"How he set himself against him on the way"
"Now go and strike Amalek"
"Devote to destruction all that they have"
"Do not spare them"
"But kill both man and woman, child and infant"
"Ox and sheep, camel and donkey"
Saul summons the people
He numbers them in Telaim
200,000 men on foot
10,000 from Judah
Saul comes to the city of Amalek
He lies in wait in the valley
Saul says to the Kenites
"Go, depart; go down from among the Amalekites"
"Lest I destroy you with them"
"For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel"
The Kenites depart
Saul defeats the Amalekites
From Havilah as far as Shur
He takes Agag the king alive
He devotes to destruction all the people with the sword
Saul and the people spare Agag
The best of the sheep, oxen, fattened calves, lambs
"All that was good"
They are unwilling to devote them to destruction
All that is despised and worthless they devote to destruction
The word of the Lord comes to Samuel
"I regret that I have made Saul king"
"For he has turned back from following me"
"He has not performed my commandments"
Samuel is angry
He cries to the Lord all night
Samuel rises early to meet Saul
Samuel is told
"Saul came to Carmel"
"He set up a monument for himself"
"He has gone on down to Gilgal"
Samuel comes to Saul
Saul: "Blessed be you to the Lord"
"I have performed the commandment of the Lord"
Samuel: "What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears?"
"And the lowing of the oxen that I hear?"
Saul: "They have brought them from the Amalekites"
"For the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen"
"To sacrifice to the Lord your God"
"The rest we have devoted to destruction"
Samuel: "Stop!"
"I will tell you what the Lord said to me this night"
"Say on"
"Though you are little in your own eyes"
"Are you not the head of the tribes of Israel?"
"The Lord anointed you king over Israel"
"The Lord sent you on a mission"
"'Go, devote to destruction the sinners, the Amalekites'"
"Why then did you not obey the voice of the Lord?"
"Why did you pounce on the spoil?"
"And do what was evil in the sight of the Lord?"
Saul: "I have obeyed the voice of the Lord"
"I have gone on the mission on which the Lord sent me"
"I have brought Agag the king of Amalek"
"I have devoted the Amalekites to destruction"
"But the people took of the spoil"
"Sheep and oxen, the best of the things devoted to destruction"
"To sacrifice to the Lord your God in Gilgal"
Samuel: "Has the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices"
"As in obeying the voice of the Lord?"
"Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice"
"To listen than the fat of rams"
"For rebellion is as the sin of divination"
"And presumption is as iniquity and idolatry"
"Because you have rejected the word of the Lord"
"He has also rejected you from being king"
Saul: "I have sinned"
"For I have transgressed the commandment of the Lord and your words"
"Because I feared the people and obeyed their voice"
"Now therefore, please pardon my sin"
"Return with me that I may bow before the Lord"
Samuel: "I will not return with you"
"For you have rejected the word of the Lord"
"The Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel"
As Samuel turns to go away
Saul seizes the skirt of his robe
It tears
Samuel: "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day"
"He has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you"
"The Glory of Israel will not lie or have regret"
"For he is not a man, that he should have regret"
Saul: "I have sinned"
"Yet honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel"
"Return with me, that I may bow before the Lord your God"
Samuel turns back after Saul
Saul bows before the Lord
Samuel: "Bring here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites"
Agag comes to him cheerfully
Agag: "Surely the bitterness of death is past"
Samuel: "As your sword has made women childless"
"So shall your mother be childless among women"
Samuel hacks Agag to pieces before the Lord in Gilgal
Samuel goes to Ramah
Saul goes up to his house in Gibeah
Samuel does not see Saul again until the day of his death
Samuel grieves over Saul
The Lord regrets that he has made Saul king over Israel
The Lord says to Samuel
"How long will you grieve over Saul?"
"I have rejected him from being king"
"Fill your horn with oil"
"I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite"
"For I have provided for myself a king among his sons"
Samuel: "How can I go?"
"If Saul hears it, he will kill me"
The Lord: "Take a heifer with you"
"Say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord'"
"Invite Jesse to the sacrifice"
"I will show you what you shall do"
"You shall anoint for me him whom I declare to you"
Samuel does what the Lord commands
He comes to Bethlehem
The elders of the city come to meet him trembling
"Do you come peaceably?"
"Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord"
"Consecrate yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice"
He consecrates Jesse and his sons
He invites them to the sacrifice
When they come, he looks on Eliab
"Surely the Lord's anointed is before him"
The Lord: "Do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature"
"For I have rejected him"
"The Lord sees not as man sees"
"Man looks on the outward appearance"
"But the Lord looks on the heart"
Jesse calls Abinadab
He makes him pass before Samuel
"Neither has the Lord chosen this one"
Jesse makes Shammah pass by
"Neither has the Lord chosen this one"
Jesse makes seven of his sons pass before Samuel
Samuel: "The Lord has not chosen these"
"Are all your sons here?"
"There remains yet the youngest"
"Behold, he is keeping the sheep"
Samuel: "Send and get him"
"We will not sit down till he comes here"
He sends and brings him in
He is ruddy
With beautiful eyes and handsome
The Lord: "Arise, anoint him"
"For this is he"
Samuel takes the horn of oil
He anoints him in the midst of his brothers
The Spirit of the Lord rushes upon David from that day forward
Samuel rises and goes to Ramah
The Spirit of the Lord departs from Saul
A harmful spirit from the Lord torments him
Saul's servants: "Behold now, a harmful spirit from God is tormenting you"
"Let our lord now command your servants"
"To seek out a man who is skillful in playing the lyre"
"When the harmful spirit is upon you"
"He will play it, and you will be well"
Saul: "Provide for me a man who can play well"
"And bring him to me"
One of the young men: "I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite"
"Who is skillful in playing"
"A man of valor, a man of war"
"Prudent in speech, and a man of good presence"
"The Lord is with him"
Saul sends messengers to Jesse
"Send me David your son, who is with the sheep"
Jesse takes a donkey laden with bread
A skin of wine and a young goat
He sends them by David to Saul
David comes to Saul
He enters his service
Saul loves him greatly
David becomes his armor-bearer
Saul sends to Jesse
"Let David remain in my service"
"For he has found favor in my sight"
Whenever the harmful spirit is upon Saul
David takes the lyre and plays it
Saul is refreshed and well
The harmful spirit departs from him
Philistines gather their armies for battle
They are gathered at Socoh
They encamp between Socoh and Azekah
Saul and the men of Israel are gathered
They encamp in the Valley of Elah
They draw up in line of battle against the Philistines
Philistines stand on the mountain on one side
Israel stands on the mountain on the other side
A valley between them
A champion comes out from the camp of the Philistines
Named Goliath of Gath
His height is six cubits and a span
He has a helmet of bronze on his head
He is armed with a coat of mail
The weight of the coat is five thousand shekels of bronze
He has bronze armor on his legs
A javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders
The shaft of his spear is like a weaver's beam
His spear's head weighs six hundred shekels of iron
A shield-bearer goes before him
He stands and shouts to the ranks of Israel
"Why have you come out to draw up for battle?"
"Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul?"
"Choose a man for yourselves"
"Let him come down to me"
"If he is able to fight with me and kill me"
"Then we will be your servants"
"But if I prevail against him and kill him"
"Then you shall be our servants and serve us"
"I defy the ranks of Israel this day"
"Give me a man, that we may fight together"
When Saul and all Israel hear these words
They are dismayed and greatly afraid
David is the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem
The man's name is Jesse
He has eight sons
In the days of Saul the man is already old
The three oldest sons of Jesse have followed Saul
Eliab the firstborn, Abinadab the second, Shammah the third
David is the youngest
The three oldest follow Saul
David goes back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep
For forty days the Philistine comes forward
Morning and evening he takes his stand
Jesse says to David
"Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain"
"These ten loaves"
"Carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers"
"Also take these ten cheeses to the commander"
"See if your brothers are well"
"Bring some token from them"
Saul and they and all the men of Israel are in the Valley of Elah
Fighting with the Philistines
David rises early in the morning
He leaves the sheep with a keeper
He takes the provisions and goes
He comes to the encampment
The army is going out to the battle line
Shouting the war cry
Israel and the Philistines draw up for battle
Army against army
David leaves the things in charge of the keeper of the baggage
He runs to the ranks
He greets his brothers
As he talks with them
The champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath, comes up
He speaks the same words as before
David hears him
All the men of Israel flee from him
They are much afraid
"Have you seen this man who has come up?"
"Surely he has come up to defy Israel"
"The king will enrich the man who kills him"
"Will give him his daughter"
"Make his father's house free in Israel"
David asks the men who stand by him
"What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine?"
"And takes away the reproach from Israel?"
"For who is this uncircumcised Philistine"
"That he should defy the armies of the living God?"
The people answer him in the same way
"So shall it be done to the man who kills him"
When the words David speaks are heard
They repeat them before Saul
Saul sends for him
David says to Saul
"Let no man's heart fail because of him"
"Your servant will go and fight with this Philistine"
Saul: "You are not able to go against this Philistine"
"You are but a youth"
"He has been a man of war from his youth"
David: "Your servant used to keep sheep for his father"
"When there came a lion, or a bear"
"And took a lamb from the flock"
"I went after him and struck him"
"I delivered it out of his mouth"
"When he arose against me"
"I caught him by his beard"
"I struck him and killed him"
"Your servant has struck down both lions and bears"
"This uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them"
"For he has defied the armies of the living God"
"The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion"
"And from the paw of the bear"
"Will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine"
Saul: "Go, and the Lord be with you"
Saul clothes David with his armor
He puts a helmet of bronze on his head
He clothes him with a coat of mail
David straps his sword over his armor
He tries in vain to go
"For he had not tested them"
David: "I cannot go with these"
"For I have not tested them"
David takes them off
He takes his staff in his hand
He chooses five smooth stones from the brook
He puts them in his shepherd's pouch
His sling is in his hand
He approaches the Philistine
The Philistine moves forward
Comes near to David
The man who carried his shield goes before him
When the Philistine looks and sees David
He disdains him
"For he was but a youth"
"Ruddy and handsome in appearance"
The Philistine: "Am I a dog"
"That you come to me with sticks?"
The Philistine curses David by his gods
"Come to me"
"I will give your flesh to the birds and to the beasts"
David: "You come to me with a sword, spear, and javelin"
"But I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts"
"The God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied"
"This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand"
"I will strike you down"
"I will take your head from you"
"I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day"
"To the birds and to the wild beasts"
"That all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel"
"That all this assembly may know"
"That the Lord saves not with sword and spear"
"For the battle is the Lord's"
"He will give you into our hand"
When the Philistine arises and comes and draws near
David runs quickly toward the battle line
David puts his hand in his bag
He takes out a stone
He slings it
It strikes the Philistine on his forehead
The stone sinks into his forehead
He falls on his face to the ground
David prevails over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone
He strikes the Philistine and kills him
There is no sword in the hand of David
David runs and stands over the Philistine
He takes his sword
He draws it out of its sheath
He kills him
He cuts off his head with it
When the Philistines see that their champion is dead
They flee
Men of Israel and Judah rise with a shout
They pursue the Philistines
As far as Gath and the gates of Ekron
The wounded Philistines fall on the way
As far as Gath and Ekron
The people of Israel come back from chasing the Philistines
They plunder their camp
David takes the head of the Philistine
He brings it to Jerusalem
He puts his armor in his tent
As soon as Saul sees David go out against the Philistine
He says to Abner, commander of the army
"Abner, whose son is this youth?"
Abner: "As your soul lives, O king, I do not know"
The king: "Inquire whose son the boy is"
As soon as David returns from striking down the Philistine
Abner takes him
He brings him before Saul
With the head of the Philistine in his hand
Saul: "Whose son are you, young man?"
David: "I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite"
As soon as he has finished speaking to Saul
The soul of Jonathan is knit to the soul of David
Jonathan loves him as his own soul
Saul takes him that day
He will not let him return to his father's house
Jonathan makes a covenant with David
Because he loves him as his own soul
Jonathan strips himself of the robe he is wearing
He gives it to David
His armor, his sword, his bow, his belt
David goes out
Wherever Saul sends him, he succeeds
Saul sets him over the men of war
This is good in the sight of all the people
Also in the sight of Saul's servants
As they are coming home
When David returns from striking down the Philistine
The women come out of all the cities of Israel
Singing and dancing to meet King Saul
With tambourines, with songs of joy, with musical instruments
The women sing to one another as they celebrate
"Saul has struck down his thousands"
"David his ten thousands"
Saul is very angry
This saying displeases him
"They have ascribed to David ten thousands"
"To me they have ascribed thousands"
"What more can he have but the kingdom?"
Saul eyes David from that day on
The next day a harmful spirit from God rushes upon Saul
He raves within his house
David is playing the lyre, as he does day by day
Saul has his spear in his hand
Saul hurls the spear
"I will pin David to the wall"
David evades him twice
Saul is afraid of David
Because the Lord is with him
But has departed from Saul
Saul removes him from his presence
He makes him a commander of a thousand
David goes out and comes in before the people
David has success in all his undertakings
The Lord is with him
When Saul sees that he has great success
He stands in fearful awe of him
All Israel and Judah love David
For he goes out and comes in before them
Saul says to David
"Here is my elder daughter Merab"
"I will give her to you for a wife"
"Only be valiant for me and fight the Lord's battles"
Saul thinks, "Let not my hand be against him"
"But let the hand of the Philistines be against him"
David: "Who am I?"
"What is my life, or my father's clan in Israel"
"That I should be son-in-law to the king?"
At the time when Merab should have been given to David
She is given to Adriel the Meholathite for a wife
Michal, Saul's daughter, loves David
When they tell Saul, the thing pleases him
Saul thinks, "Let me give her to him"
"That she may be a snare for him"
"That the hand of the Philistines may be against him"
Saul says to David a second time
"You shall now be my son-in-law"
Saul commands his servants
"Speak to David in private"
"'See, the king delights in you'"
"'All his servants love you'"
"'Now then become the king's son-in-law'"
Saul's servants speak these words in the ears of David
David: "Does it seem to you a little thing to become the king's son-in-law?"
"I am a poor man and have no reputation"
The servants tell Saul
"Thus and so did David speak"
Saul: "Thus shall you say to David"
"'The king desires no bride-price except a hundred foreskins'"
"That he may be avenged of the king's enemies"
Saul plans to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines
His servants tell David these words
It pleases David well to be the king's son-in-law
Before the time had expired
David arises and goes
He and his men
They strike down two hundred of the Philistines
David brings their foreskins
They give them in full number to the king
That he may become the king's son-in-law
Saul gives him his daughter Michal for a wife
When Saul sees and knows that the Lord is with David
That Michal, Saul's daughter, loves him
Saul is even more afraid of David
Saul is David's enemy continually
The princes of the Philistines come out to battle
As often as they come out
David has more success than all the servants of Saul
His name is highly esteemed
Saul speaks to Jonathan his son
To all his servants
That they should kill David
Jonathan, Saul's son, delights much in David
Jonathan tells David
"Saul my father seeks to kill you"
"Therefore be on your guard in the morning"
"Stay in a secret place and hide yourself"
"I will go out and stand beside my father in the field"
"I will speak to my father about you"
"If I learn anything I will tell you"
Jonathan speaks well of David to Saul
"Let not the king sin against his servant David"
"Because he has not sinned against you"
"His deeds have brought good to you"
"He took his life in his hand"
"He struck down the Philistine"
"The Lord worked a great salvation for all Israel"
"You saw it, and rejoiced"
"Why then will you sin against innocent blood"
"By killing David without cause?"
Saul listens to the voice of Jonathan
Saul swears, "As the Lord lives, he shall not be put to death"
Jonathan calls David
He tells him all these things
Jonathan brings David to Saul
He is in his presence as before
There is war again
David goes out and fights with the Philistines
He strikes them with a great blow
They flee before him
A harmful spirit from the Lord is upon Saul
As he sits in his house with his spear in his hand
David is playing the lyre
Saul seeks to pin David to the wall with the spear
He eludes Saul
The spear strikes into the wall
David flees and escapes that night
Saul sends messengers to David's house to watch him
To kill him in the morning
Michal, David's wife, tells him
"If you do not escape with your life tonight"
"Tomorrow you will be killed"
Michal lets David down through the window
He flees away and escapes
Michal takes an image
She lays it on the bed
She puts a pillow of goats' hair at its head
She covers it with the clothes
When Saul sends messengers to take David
She says, "He is sick"
Saul sends the messengers to see David
"Bring him up to me in the bed"
"That I may kill him"
When the messengers come in
The image is in the bed
With the pillow of goats' hair at its head
Saul: "Why have you deceived me thus?"
"You have let my enemy go, so that he has escaped"
Michal: "He said to me, 'Let me go'"
"'Why should I kill you?'"
David flees and escapes
He comes to Samuel at Ramah
He tells him all that Saul has done to him
He and Samuel go and dwell at Naioth
It is told Saul
"Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah"
Saul sends messengers to take David
When they see the company of the prophets prophesying
Samuel standing as head over them
The Spirit of God comes upon the messengers of Saul
They also prophesy
When it is told Saul
He sends other messengers
They also prophesy
Saul sends messengers again the third time
They also prophesy
Then he himself goes to Ramah
He comes to the great well that is in Secu
"Where are Samuel and David?"
"They are at Naioth in Ramah"
He goes there to Naioth in Ramah
The Spirit of God comes upon him also
He goes on and prophesies
Until he comes to Naioth in Ramah
He also strips off his clothes
He also prophesies before Samuel
He lies naked all that day and all that night
"Is Saul also among the prophets?"
David flees from Naioth in Ramah
He comes and says before Jonathan
"What have I done?"
"What is my guilt?"
"What is my sin before your father"
"That he seeks my life?"
Jonathan: "Far from it! You shall not die"
"My father does nothing great or small without disclosing it to me"
"Why should my father hide this from me?"
"It is not so"
David vows again
"Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes"
"He thinks, 'Let not Jonathan know this'"
"Lest he be grieved"
"But truly, as the Lord lives and as your soul lives"
"There is but a step between me and death"
Jonathan: "Whatever you say, I will do for you"
David: "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon"
"I should not fail to sit at table with the king"
"But let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day"
"If your father misses me at all"
"Then say, 'David earnestly asked leave of me'"
"'To run to Bethlehem his city'"
"'For there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the clan'"
"If he says, 'Good!' it will be well with your servant"
"But if he is angry, know that harm is determined by him"
"Deal kindly with your servant"
"For you have brought your servant into a covenant of the Lord with you"
"But if there is guilt in me, kill me yourself"
"Why should you bring me to your father?"
Jonathan: "Far be it from you!"
"If I knew that harm was determined by my father"
"Would I not tell you?"
David: "Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"
Jonathan: "Come, let us go out into the field"
They go out into the field
Jonathan says to David
"The Lord, the God of Israel, be witness!"
"When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow"
"If he is well disposed toward David"
"Shall I not then send and disclose it to you?"
"But should it please my father to do you harm"
"The Lord do so to Jonathan and more also"
"If I do not disclose it to you and send you away"
"That you may go in safety"
"May the Lord be with you, as he has been with my father"
"If I am still alive, show me the steadfast love of the Lord"
"That I may not die"
"Do not cut off your steadfast love from my house forever"
"When the Lord cuts off every one of the enemies of David"
Jonathan makes a covenant with the house of David
"May the Lord take vengeance on David's enemies"
Jonathan makes David swear again by his love for him
"For he loved him as he loved his own soul"
Jonathan: "Tomorrow is the new moon"
"You will be missed, because your seat will be empty"
"On the third day go down quickly"
"Go to the place where you hid yourself"
"Remain beside the stone heap"
"I will shoot three arrows to the side of it"
"As though I shot at a mark"
"I will send the boy, saying, 'Go, find the arrows'"
"If I say to the boy, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them'"
"Then you are to come, for, as the Lord lives, it is safe"
"There is no danger"
"But if I say to the youth, 'Look, the arrows are beyond you'"
"Then go, for the Lord has sent you away"
"As for the matter of which you and I have spoken"
"Behold, the Lord is between you and me forever"
David hides himself in the field
When the new moon comes
The king sits down to eat food
The king sits on his seat, as at other times
On the seat by the wall
Jonathan sits opposite
Abner sits by Saul's side
David's place is empty
Saul does not say anything that day
He thinks, "Something has happened to him"
"He is not clean; surely he is not clean"
On the second day, the day after the new moon
David's place is empty
Saul says to Jonathan
"Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal?"
"Either yesterday or today?"
Jonathan: "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem"
"He said, 'Let me go'"
"'Our clan holds a sacrifice in the city'"
"'My brother has commanded me to be there'"
"'If I have found favor in your eyes'"
"'Let me get away and see my brothers'"
"'That is why he has not come to the king's table'"
Saul's anger is kindled against Jonathan
"You son of a perverse, rebellious woman"
"Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse"
"To your own shame"
"And to the shame of your mother's nakedness?"
"For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth"
"Neither you nor your kingdom shall be established"
"Now send and bring him to me"
"For he shall surely die"
Jonathan: "Why should he be put to death?"
"What has he done?"
Saul hurls his spear at him to strike him
Jonathan knows that his father is determined to put David to death
Jonathan rises from the table in fierce anger
He eats no food the second day of the month
"For he is grieved for David"
"Because his father has disgraced him"
In the morning Jonathan goes out into the field
To the appointment with David
A little boy is with him
He says to his boy, "Run and find the arrows that I shoot"
As the boy runs, he shoots an arrow beyond him
When the boy comes to the place of the arrow
Jonathan cries after the boy
"Is not the arrow beyond you?"
Jonathan cries after the boy
"Hurry! Be quick! Do not stay!"
Jonathan's boy gathers up the arrows
He comes to his master
The boy knows nothing
Only Jonathan and David know the matter
Jonathan gives his weapons to his boy
"Go and carry them to the city"
As soon as the boy has gone
David rises from beside the stone heap
He falls on his face to the ground
He bows three times
They kiss one another
They weep with one another
David weeps the most
Jonathan: "Go in peace"
"Because we have sworn both of us in the name of the Lord"
"'The Lord shall be between me and you'"
"'And between my offspring and your offspring, forever'"
David rises and departs
Jonathan goes into the city
David comes to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest
Ahimelech comes to meet David trembling
"Why are you alone?"
"No one with you?"
David: "The king has charged me with a matter"
"'Let no one know anything of the matter'"
"I have made an appointment with the young men"
"Now then, what do you have on hand?"
"Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here"
The priest: "I have no common bread on hand"
"But there is holy bread"
"If the young men have kept themselves from women"
David: "Truly women have been kept from us"
"As always when I go on an expedition"
"The vessels of the young men are holy"
"Even when it is an ordinary journey"
"How much more today will their vessels be holy?"
The priest gives him the holy bread
"For there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence"
"Which is removed from before the Lord"
"To be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away"
Now a certain man of the servants of Saul is there that day
Detained before the Lord
His name is Doeg the Edomite
The chief of Saul's herdsmen
David says to Ahimelech
"Is there not here a spear or sword on hand?"
"I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me"
"Because the king's business required haste"
The priest: "The sword of Goliath the Philistine"
"Whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah"
"Behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod"
"If you will take that, take it"
"For there is none but that here"
David: "There is none like that; give it to me"
David rises and flees that day from Saul
He goes to Achish the king of Gath
The servants of Achish say to him
"Is not this David the king of the land?"
"Did they not sing to one another of him in dances"
"'Saul has struck down his thousands'"
"'David his ten thousands'?"
David takes these words to heart
He is much afraid of Achish the king of Gath
He changes his behavior before them
He pretends to be insane in their hands
He makes marks on the doors of the gate
He lets his spittle run down his beard
Achish says to his servants
"Behold, you see the man is mad"
"Why then have you brought him to me?"
"Do I lack madmen"
"That you have brought this fellow to behave as a madman in my presence?"
"Shall this fellow come into my house?"
David departs from there
He escapes to the cave of Adullam
When his brothers and all his father's house hear it
They go down there to him
Everyone who is in distress gathers to him
Everyone who is in debt
Everyone who is bitter in soul
He becomes commander over them
There are with him about four hundred men
David goes from there to Mizpeh of Moab
He says to the king of Moab
"Please let my father and my mother stay with you"
"Till I know what God will do for me"
He leaves them with the king of Moab
They stay with him all the time David is in the stronghold
The prophet Gad says to David
"Do not remain in the stronghold"
"Depart, and go into the land of Judah"
David departs
He goes into the forest of Hereth
Saul hears that David is discovered
And the men who are with him
Saul is sitting at Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height
His spear in his hand
All his servants are standing about him
Saul says to his servants who stand about him
"Hear now, people of Benjamin"
"Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards?"
"Will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?"
"That all of you have conspired against me?"
"No one discloses to me when my son makes a covenant with the son of Jesse"
"None of you is sorry for me"
"Or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant against me"
"To lie in wait, as at this day"
Doeg the Edomite, who stands by the servants of Saul, answers
"I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob"
"To Ahimelech the son of Ahitub"
"He inquired of the Lord for him"
"Gave him provisions"
"Gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine"
The king sends to summon Ahimelech the priest
All his father's house, the priests who are at Nob
All of them come to the king
Saul: "Hear now, son of Ahitub"
"Here I am, my lord"
"Why have you conspired against me"
"You and the son of Jesse"
"In that you have given him bread and a sword"
"Have inquired of God for him"
"So that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day"
Ahimelech: "Who among all your servants is so faithful as David?"
"Who is the king's son-in-law"
"Who turns aside to do your bidding"
"Who is honored in your house?"
"Is today the first time I have inquired of God for him?"
"No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant"
"Or to all the house of my father"
"For your servant has known nothing of all this"
"Much or little"
The king: "You shall surely die, Ahimelech"
"You and all your father's house"
The king says to the guard who stands about him
"Turn and kill the priests of the Lord"
"Because their hand also is with David"
"They knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me"
The servants of the king will not put out their hand
To strike the priests of the Lord
The king says to Doeg
"You turn and strike the priests"
Doeg the Edomite turns and strikes the priests
He kills on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod
Nob, the city of the priests, he puts to the sword
Both man and woman, child and infant
Ox, donkey, and sheep, he puts to the sword
One of the sons of Ahimelech escapes
His name is Abiathar
He flees after David
Abiathar tells David that Saul has killed the priests
David: "I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there"
"That he would surely tell Saul"
"I have occasioned the death of all the persons of your father's house"
"Stay with me; do not be afraid"
"For he who seeks my life seeks your life"
"With me you shall be in safekeeping"
They tell David
"Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah"
"They are robbing the threshing floors"
David inquires of the Lord
"Shall I go and attack these Philistines?"
The Lord: "Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah"
David's men: "Behold, we are afraid here in Judah"
"How much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies?"
David inquires of the Lord again
The Lord: "Arise, go down to Keilah"
"For I will give the Philistines into your hand"
David and his men go to Keilah
They fight with the Philistines
They bring away their livestock
They strike them with a great blow
David saves the inhabitants of Keilah
When Abiathar flees to David at Keilah
He comes down with an ephod in his hand
It is told Saul that David has come to Keilah
Saul: "God has given him into my hand"
"For he has shut himself in by entering a town that has gates and bars"
Saul summons all the people to war
To go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men
David knows that Saul is plotting harm against him
He says to Abiathar: "Bring the ephod here"
David: "O Lord, the God of Israel"
"Your servant has surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah"
"To destroy the city on my account"
"Will the men of Keilah surrender me into his hand?"
"Will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?"
"O Lord, the God of Israel, please tell your servant"
The Lord: "He will come down"
"Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men into the hand of Saul?"
The Lord: "They will surrender you"
David and his men, about six hundred, arise
They depart from Keilah
They go wherever they can go
When Saul is told that David has escaped from Keilah
He gives up the expedition
David remains in the strongholds in the wilderness
In the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph
Saul seeks him every day
God does not give him into his hand
David sees that Saul has come out to seek his life
David is in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh
Jonathan, Saul's son, rises
He goes to David at Horesh
He strengthens his hand in God
"Do not fear"
"For the hand of Saul my father shall not find you"
"You shall be king over Israel"
"I shall be next to you"
"Saul my father also knows this"
The two of them make a covenant before the Lord
David remains at Horesh
Jonathan goes home
The Ziphites go up to Saul at Gibeah
"Is not David hiding among us in the strongholds at Horesh?"
"On the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?"
"Now, O king, come down"
"Whenever your soul desires to come down"
"Our part shall be to surrender him into the king's hand"
Saul: "May you be blessed by the Lord"
"For you have had compassion on me"
"Go, make yet more sure"
"Know and see the place where his foot is"
"Who has seen him there"
"For it is told me that he is very cunning"
"See therefore and take note of all the lurking places"
"Come back to me with sure information"
"Then I will go with you"
"If he is in the land, I will search him out"
"Among all the thousands of Judah"
They arise and go to Ziph ahead of Saul
David and his men are in the wilderness of Maon
In the Arabah to the south of Jeshimon
Saul and his men go to seek him
David is told
He goes down to the rock
He remains in the wilderness of Maon
When Saul hears that
He pursues after David in the wilderness of Maon
Saul goes on one side of the mountain
David and his men on the other side
David is hurrying to get away from Saul
As Saul and his men are closing in on David and his men to capture them
A messenger comes to Saul
"Hurry and come"
"For the Philistines have made a raid against the land"
Saul returns from pursuing after David
He goes against the Philistines
That place is called the Rock of Escape
David goes up from there
He dwells in the strongholds of Engedi
When Saul returns from following the Philistines
He is told
"Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi"
Saul takes three thousand chosen men out of all Israel
He goes to seek David and his men
In front of the Wildgoats' Rocks
He comes to the sheepfolds by the way
A cave is there
Saul goes in to relieve himself
David and his men are sitting in the innermost parts of the cave
The men of David say to him
"Here is the day of which the Lord said to you"
"'Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand'"
"'You shall do to him as it shall seem good to you'"
David rises and stealthily cuts off a corner of Saul's robe
Afterward David's heart strikes him
"Because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe"
He says to his men
"The Lord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord"
"The Lord's anointed"
"To put out my hand against him"
"Seeing he is the Lord's anointed"
David persuades his men with these words
He does not permit them to attack Saul
Saul rises up and leaves the cave
He goes on his way
Afterward David also rises
He goes out of the cave
He calls after Saul
"My lord the king!"
When Saul looks behind him
David bows with his face to the earth
He prostrates himself
David: "Why do you listen to the words of men who say"
"'Behold, David seeks your harm'?"
"Behold, this day your eyes have seen"
"How the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave"
"Some told me to kill you"
"But I spared you"
"I said, 'I will not put out my hand against my lord'"
"'For he is the Lord's anointed'"
"See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand"
"For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe"
"And did not kill you"
"You may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands"
"I have not sinned against you"
"Though you hunt my life to take it"
"May the Lord judge between me and you"
"May the Lord avenge me against you"
"But my hand shall not be against you"
"As the proverb of the ancients says"
"'Out of the wicked comes wickedness'"
"But my hand shall not be against you"
"After whom has the king of Israel come out?"
"After whom do you pursue?"
"After a dead dog! After a flea!"
"May the Lord therefore be judge"
"And give sentence between me and you"
"May he see to it and plead my cause"
"And deliver me from your hand"
As soon as David finishes speaking these words to Saul
Saul: "Is this your voice, my son David?"
Saul lifts up his voice and weeps
"You are more righteous than I"
"For you have repaid me good"
"Whereas I have repaid you evil"
"You have declared this day how you have dealt well with me"
"In that you did not kill me when the Lord put me into your hands"
"For if a man finds his enemy"
"Will he let him go away safe?"
"So may the Lord reward you with good"
"For what you have done to me this day"
"Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king"
"The kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand"
"Swear to me therefore by the Lord"
"That you will not cut off my offspring after me"
"That you will not destroy my name out of my father's house"
David swears this to Saul
Saul goes home
David and his men go up to the stronghold
Samuel dies
All Israel assembles and mourns for him
They bury him in his house at Ramah
David is in the wilderness of Maon
There is a man in Maon whose business is in Carmel
The man is very rich
He has three thousand sheep and a thousand goats
He is shearing his sheep in Carmel
The name of the man is Nabal
The name of his wife is Abigail
The woman is discerning and beautiful
The man is harsh and badly behaved
He is a Calebite
David hears in the wilderness that Nabal is shearing his sheep
David sends ten young men
"Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal"
"Greet him in my name"
"Thus you shall greet him: 'Peace be to you'"
"'Peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have'"
"I hear that you have shearers"
"Now your shepherds have been with us"
"We did them no harm"
"They missed nothing all the time they were in Carmel"
"Ask your young men, and they will tell you"
"Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes"
"For we come on a feast day"
"Please give whatever you have at hand to your servants"
"And to your son David"
When David's young men come, they say all this to Nabal
In the name of David
Then they wait
Nabal answers David's servants
"Who is David?"
"Who is the son of Jesse?"
"There are many servants these days who are breaking away from their masters"
"Shall I take my bread and my water"
"And my meat that I have killed for my shearers"
"And give it to men who come from I do not know where?"
David's young men turn away
They come back and tell him all this
David says to his men
"Every man strap on his sword"
Every man straps on his sword
David also straps on his sword
About four hundred men go up after David
Two hundred remain with the baggage
One of the young men tells Abigail, Nabal's wife
"Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to greet our master"
"He railed at them"
"Yet the men were very good to us"
"We suffered no harm"
"We did not miss anything when we were in the fields"
"They were a wall to us both by night and by day"
"All the while we were with them keeping the sheep"
"Now therefore know this and consider what you should do"
"For harm is determined against our master and against all his house"
"For he is such a worthless man that one cannot speak to him"
Abigail makes haste
She takes two hundred loaves and two skins of wine
Five sheep already prepared
Five seahs of parched grain
A hundred clusters of raisins
Two hundred cakes of figs
She lays them on donkeys
She says to her young men, "Go on before me"
"Behold, I come after you"
She does not tell her husband Nabal
As she rides on the donkey and comes down under cover of the mountain
Behold, David and his men come down toward her
She meets them
David has just said
"Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness"
"So that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him"
"He has returned me evil for good"
"God do so to the enemies of David and more also"
"If by morning I leave so much as one male of all who belong to him"
When Abigail sees David
She hurries and gets down from the donkey
She falls before David on her face
She bows to the ground
She falls at his feet
"On me alone, my lord, be the guilt"
"Please let your servant speak in your ears"
"Hear the words of your servant"
"Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal"
"For as his name is, so is he"
"Nabal is his name, and folly is with him"
"But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord"
"Whom you sent"
"Now then, my lord, as the Lord lives, and as your soul lives"
"Because the Lord has restrained you from bloodguilt"
"And from saving with your own hand"
"Now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord"
"Be as Nabal"
"And now let this present that your servant has brought to my lord"
"Be given to the young men who follow my lord"
"Please forgive the trespass of your servant"
"For the Lord will certainly make my lord a sure house"
"Because my lord is fighting the battles of the Lord"
"And evil shall not be found in you so long as you live"
"If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life"
"The life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living"
"In the care of the Lord your God"
"And the lives of your enemies he shall sling out"
"As from the hollow of a sling"
"When the Lord has done to my lord according to all the good"
"And has appointed you prince over Israel"
"My lord shall have no cause of grief or pangs of conscience"
"For having shed blood without cause"
"Or for my lord working salvation with his own hand"
"And when the Lord has dealt well with my lord"
"Then remember your servant"
David says to Abigail
"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me"
"Blessed be your discretion"
"Blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt"
"And from working salvation with my own hand"
"For as surely as the Lord, the God of Israel, lives"
"Who has restrained me from hurting you"
"Unless you had hurried and come to meet me"
"Truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male"
David receives from her hand what she has brought him
"Go up in peace to your house"
"See, I have obeyed your voice"
"I have granted your petition"
Abigail comes to Nabal
Behold, he is holding a feast in his house
Like the feast of a king
Nabal's heart is merry within him
For he is very drunk
She tells him nothing at all until the morning light
In the morning, when the wine has gone out of Nabal
His wife tells him these things
His heart dies within him
He becomes as a stone
About ten days later the Lord strikes Nabal
He dies
When David hears that Nabal is dead
"Blessed be the Lord who has avenged the insult I received"
"Who has kept back his servant from wrongdoing"
"The Lord has returned the evil of Nabal on his own head"
David sends and speaks to Abigail
To take her as his wife
When the servants of David come to Abigail at Carmel
They say, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife"
She rises and bows with her face to the ground
"Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet of the servants"
Abigail hurries and rises
She rides on a donkey
With five young women attending her
She follows the messengers of David
She becomes his wife
David also takes Ahinoam of Jezreel
Both of them become his wives
Saul has given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Palti
The Ziphites come to Saul at Gibeah
"Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachilah?"
Saul arises and goes down to the wilderness of Ziph
With three thousand chosen men of Israel
To seek David
Saul encamps on the hill of Hachilah
David remains in the wilderness
When he sees that Saul comes after him into the wilderness
David sends out spies
He learns that Saul has indeed come
David rises and comes to the place where Saul has encamped
David sees the place where Saul lay
With Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army
Saul is lying within the encampment
The army is encamped around him
David says to Ahimelech the Hittite
And to Joab's brother Abishai the son of Zeruiah
"Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?"
Abishai: "I will go down with you"
David and Abishai go to the army by night
There lay Saul sleeping within the encampment
His spear stuck in the ground at his head
Abner and the army lying around him
Abishai says to David
"God has given your enemy into your hand this day"
"Now please let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear"
"I will not strike him twice"
David: "Do not destroy him"
"For who can put out his hand against the Lord's anointed"
"And be guiltless?"
"As the Lord lives, the Lord will strike him"
"Or his day will come to die"
"Or he will go down into battle and perish"
"The Lord forbid that I should put out my hand"
"Against the Lord's anointed"
"But take now the spear that is at his head"
"And the jar of water"
"And let us go"
David takes the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head
They go away
No man sees it or knows it
Nor does any awake
For they are all asleep
Because a deep sleep from the Lord has fallen upon them
David goes over to the other side
He stands far off on the top of the hill
A great space is between them
David calls to the army
To Abner the son of Ner
"Will you not answer, Abner?"
Abner: "Who are you who calls to the king?"
David: "Are you not a man?"
"Who is like you in Israel?"
"Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king?"
"For one of the people came in to destroy the king"
"This thing that you have done is not good"
"As the Lord lives, you deserve to die"
"Because you have not kept watch over your lord"
"The Lord's anointed"
"And now see where the king's spear is"
"And the jar of water that was at his head"
Saul recognizes David's voice
"Is this your voice, my son David?"
David: "It is my voice, my lord, O king"
"Why does my lord pursue after his servant?"
"For what have I done?"
"What evil is on my hands?"
"Now therefore let my lord the king hear the words of his servant"
"If it is the Lord who has stirred you up against me"
"May he accept an offering"
"But if it is men, may they be cursed before the Lord"
"For they have driven me out this day"
"That I should have no share in the heritage of the Lord"
"Saying, 'Go, serve other gods'"
"Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth"
"Away from the presence of the Lord"
"For the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea"
"Like one who hunts a partridge in the mountains"
Saul: "I have sinned"
"Return, my son David"
"For I will no more do you harm"
"Because my life was precious in your eyes this day"
"Behold, I have acted foolishly"
"I have made a great mistake"
David: "Here is the spear, O king"
"Let one of the young men come over and take it"
"The Lord rewards every man for his righteousness and his faithfulness"
"For the Lord gave you into my hand today"
"I would not put out my hand against the Lord's anointed"
"Behold, as your life was precious this day in my sight"
"So may my life be precious in the sight of the Lord"
"May he deliver me out of all tribulation"
Saul: "Blessed be you, my son David"
"You will do many things and will succeed in them"
David goes his way
Saul returns to his place
David says in his heart
"Now I shall perish one day by the hand of Saul"
"There is nothing better for me than that I should escape"
"To the land of the Philistines"
"Then Saul will despair of seeking me any longer within the borders"
"And I shall escape out of his hand"
David arises and goes over
He and the six hundred men who are with him
To Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath
David lived with Achish at Gath
He and his men, every man with his household
David with his two wives
Ahinoam of Jezreel, and Abigail of Carmel
When it is told Saul that David has fled to Gath
He no longer seeks him
David says to Achish
"If I have found favor in your eyes"
"Let a place be given me in one of the country towns"
"That I may dwell there"
"For why should your servant dwell in the royal city with you?"
Achish gives him Ziklag that day
Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day
The number of the days David lived in the country of the Philistines
Was a year and four months
David and his men go up and make raids
Against the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites
For these were the inhabitants of the land from of old
David strikes the land
He leaves neither man nor woman alive
He takes away the sheep, oxen, donkeys, camels, and garments
He returns and comes to Achish
When Achish asks, "Where have you made a raid today?"
David says, "Against the Negeb of Judah"
Or, "Against the Negeb of the Jerahmeelites"
Or, "Against the Negeb of the Kenites"
David leaves neither man nor woman alive to bring news to Gath
Thinking, "Lest they should tell about us"
Such was his custom all the while he lived in the country of the Philistines
Achish trusts David
Thinking, "He has made himself an utter stench to his people Israel"
"Therefore he shall always be my servant"
The Philistines gather all their forces for war
To fight against Israel
Achish says to David
"Understand that you and your men are to go out with me in the army"
David: "Very well, you shall know what your servant can do"
Achish: "Very well, I will make you my bodyguard for life"
Samuel has died
All Israel has mourned for him and buried him in Ramah
Saul has put the mediums and the necromancers out of the land
The Philistines assemble
They come and encamp at Shunem
Saul gathers all Israel
They encamp at Gilboa
When Saul sees the army of the Philistines
He is afraid
His heart trembles greatly
When Saul inquires of the Lord
The Lord does not answer him
Either by dreams, or by Urim, or by prophets
Saul says to his servants
"Seek out for me a woman who is a medium"
"That I may go to her and inquire of her"
His servants: "Behold, there is a medium at En-dor"
Saul disguises himself
He puts on other garments
He goes, he and two men with him
They come to the woman by night
"Divine for me by a spirit"
"Bring up for me whomever I shall name to you"
The woman: "Surely you know what Saul has done"
"How he has cut off the mediums and the necromancers from the land"
"Why then are you laying a trap for my life"
"To bring about my death?"
Saul swears to her by the Lord
"As the Lord lives, no punishment shall come upon you"
The woman: "Whom shall I bring up for you?"
"Bring up Samuel for me"
When the woman sees Samuel
She cries out with a loud voice
The woman: "Why have you deceived me?"
"You are Saul"
The king: "Do not be afraid"
"What do you see?"
The woman: "I see a god coming up out of the earth"
"What is his appearance?"
"An old man is coming up"
"He is wrapped in a robe"
Saul knows that it is Samuel
He bows with his face to the ground
He prostrates himself
Samuel: "Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?"
Saul: "I am in great distress"
"For the Philistines are warring against me"
"God has turned away from me"
"He answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams"
"Therefore I have summoned you to tell me what I shall do"
Samuel: "Why then do you ask me"
"Since the Lord has turned from you and become your enemy?"
"The Lord has done to you as he spoke by me"
"For the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand"
"He has given it to your neighbor, David"
"Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord"
"And did not carry out his fierce wrath against Amalek"
"Therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day"
"Moreover, the Lord will give Israel also with you"
"Into the hand of the Philistines"
"Tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me"
"The Lord will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines"
Saul falls at once full length on the ground
Filled with fear because of the words of Samuel
There is no strength in him
For he has eaten nothing all day and all night
The woman comes to Saul
She sees that he is terrified
"Behold, your servant has obeyed you"
"I have taken my life in my hand"
"I have listened to what you have said to me"
"Now therefore, you also obey your servant"
"Let me set a morsel of bread before you"
"Eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way"
He refuses: "I will not eat"
His servants, together with the woman, urge him
He listens to their words
He arises from the earth
He sits on the bed
The woman has a fattened calf in the house
She quickly kills it
She takes flour and kneads it
She bakes unleavened bread
She puts it before Saul and his servants
They eat
They rise and go away that night
The Philistines gather all their forces at Aphek
The Israelites are encamped by the spring that is in Jezreel
As the lords of the Philistines are passing on by hundreds and by thousands
David and his men are passing on in the rear with Achish
The commanders of the Philistines: "What are these Hebrews doing here?"
Achish: "Is this not David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel?"
"Who has been with me now for days and years"
"Since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day"
The commanders of the Philistines are angry with him
"Send the man back"
"That he may return to the place to which you have assigned him"
"He shall not go down with us to battle"
"Lest in the battle he become an adversary to us"
"For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord?"
"Would it not be with the heads of the men here?"
"Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances"
"'Saul has struck down his thousands'"
"'And David his ten thousands'?"
Achish calls David
"As the Lord lives, you have been honest"
"Your going out and your coming in with me in the camp has been blameless"
"For to this day I have found nothing wrong in you"
"From the day of your coming to me to this day"
"Nevertheless, the lords do not approve of you"
"So go back now; and go peaceably"
"That you may not displease the lords of the Philistines"
David: "But what have I done?"
"What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service"
"Until now, that I may not go and fight"
"Against the enemies of my lord the king?"
Achish: "I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God"
"Nevertheless, the commanders of the Philistines have said"
"'He shall not go up with us to the battle'"
"Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord"
"As soon as you have light, depart"
David sets out with his men early in the morning
To return to the land of the Philistines
The Philistines go up to Jezreel
When David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day
The Amalekites have made a raid against the Negeb and against Ziklag
They have overcome Ziklag and burned it with fire
They have taken captive the women and all who were in it
Both small and great
They kill no one
But carry them off and go their way
When David and his men come to the city
They find it burned with fire
Their wives and sons and daughters taken captive
David and the people who are with him raise their voices and weep
Until they have no more strength to weep
David's two wives also have been taken captive
Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel
David is greatly distressed
For the people speak of stoning him
Because all the people are bitter in soul
Each for his sons and daughters
But David strengthens himself in the Lord his God
David says to Abiathar the priest
"Bring me the ephod"
Abiathar brings the ephod to David
David inquires of the Lord
"Shall I pursue after this band?"
"Shall I overtake them?"
The Lord: "Pursue, for you shall surely overtake"
"And shall surely rescue"
David sets out, and the six hundred men who are with him
They come to the brook Besor
There those stay behind who are left behind
David and four hundred men continue the pursuit
Two hundred stay behind, too exhausted to cross the brook
They find an Egyptian in the open country
They bring him to David
They give him bread and he eats
They give him water to drink
They give him a piece of a cake of figs
Two clusters of raisins
When he has eaten, his spirit revives
For he has not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights
David: "To whom do you belong?"
"Where are you from?"
"I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite"
"My master left me behind"
"Because I fell sick three days ago"
"We had made a raid against the Negeb of the Cherethites"
"Against that which belongs to Judah"
"Against the Negeb of Caleb"
"We burned Ziklag with fire"
David: "Will you take me down to this band?"
"Swear to me by God that you will not kill me"
"Or deliver me into the hands of my master"
"And I will take you down to this band"
He takes him down
Behold, they are spread abroad over all the land
Eating and drinking and dancing
Because of all the great spoil they have taken
From the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah
David strikes them down from twilight until the evening of the next day
Not a man of them escapes
Except four hundred young men
Who mount camels and flee
David recovers all that the Amalekites have taken
David rescues his two wives
Nothing is missing
Whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything
David brings back all
David also captures all the flocks and herds
They drive the livestock before him
"This is David's spoil"
David comes to the two hundred men
Who have been too exhausted to follow David
Who had been left at the brook Besor
They go out to meet David and to meet the people
When David comes near to the people he greets them
Then all the wicked and worthless fellows among the men who have gone with David say
"Because they did not go with us"
"We will not give them any of the spoil that we have recovered"
"Except that each man may lead away his wife and children"
"And depart"
David: "You shall not do so, my brothers"
"With what the Lord has given us"
"He has preserved us"
"He has given into our hand the band that came against us"
"Who would listen to you in this matter?"
"For as his share is who goes down into the battle"
"So shall his share be who stays by the baggage"
"They shall share alike"
And he makes it a statute and a rule for Israel
From that day forward to this day
When David comes to Ziklag
He sends part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah
"Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord"
The Philistines fight against Israel
The men of Israel flee before the Philistines
They fall slain on Mount Gilboa
The Philistines overtake Saul and his sons
The Philistines strike down Jonathan
Abinadab
Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul
The battle presses hard against Saul
The archers find him
He is badly wounded by the archers
Saul says to his armor-bearer
"Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it"
"Lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through"
"And mistreat me"
His armor-bearer will not
For he fears greatly
Therefore Saul takes his own sword
He falls upon it
When his armor-bearer sees that Saul is dead
He also falls upon his sword
He dies with him
Thus Saul dies
His three sons
His armor-bearer
All his men, on the same day together
When the men of Israel who are on the other side of the valley
And those beyond the Jordan
See that the men of Israel have fled
And that Saul and his sons are dead
They abandon their cities and flee
The Philistines come and dwell in them
The next day, when the Philistines come to strip the slain
They find Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa
They cut off his head
They strip off his armor
They send messengers throughout the land of the Philistines
To carry the good news to the house of their idols
And to the people
They put his armor in the temple of Ashtaroth
They fasten his body to the wall of Beth-shan
When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead hear what the Philistines have done
All the valiant men arise
They go all night
They take the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall
They come to Jabesh and burn them there
They take their bones
They bury them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh
They fast seven days
After the death of Saul
When David has returned from striking down the Amalekites
David remains two days in Ziklag
On the third day, behold, a man comes from Saul's camp
His clothes are torn and earth is on his head
When he comes to David, he falls to the ground
He prostrates himself
David: "Where do you come from?"
"I have escaped from the camp of Israel"
"How did it go? Tell me"
"The people have fled from the battle"
"Many of the people also have fallen and are dead"
"Saul and his son Jonathan also are dead"
David: "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
The young man: "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa"
"There was Saul leaning on his spear"
"The chariots and the horsemen were close upon him"
"When he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me"
"I answered, 'Here I am'"
"He said to me, 'Who are you?'"
"I answered, 'I am an Amalekite'"
"He said to me, 'Stand beside me and kill me'"
"'For anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers'"
"So I stood beside him and killed him"
"Because I was sure that he could not live"
"I took the crown that was on his head"
"And the armlet that was on his arm"
"I have brought them here to my lord"
David takes hold of his clothes
He tears them
All the men who are with him do likewise
They mourn and weep and fast until evening
For Saul and for Jonathan his son
For the people of the Lord and for the house of Israel
Because they have fallen by the sword
David says to the young man who told him
"Where do you come from?"
"I am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite"
David: "How is it you were not afraid"
"To put out your hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?"
David calls one of the young men
"Go, execute him"
He strikes him down so that he dies
David: "Your blood be on your head"
"For your own mouth has testified against you"
"'I have killed the Lord's anointed'"
David laments with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan
He orders that the people of Judah be taught The Song of the Bow
"Your glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places"
"How the mighty have fallen"
"Tell it not in Gath"
"Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon"
"Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice"
"Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult"
"You mountains of Gilboa"
"Let there be no dew or rain upon you"
"Nor fields of offerings"
"For there the shield of the mighty was defiled"
"The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil"
"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty"
"The bow of Jonathan turned not back"
"The sword of Saul returned not empty"
"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely"
"In life and in death they were not divided"
"They were swifter than eagles"
"They were stronger than lions"
"You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul"
"Who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet"
"Who put ornaments of gold on your apparel"
"How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle"
"Jonathan lies slain on your high places"
"I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan"
"Very pleasant have you been to me"
"Your love to me was extraordinary"
"Surpassing the love of women"
"How the mighty have fallen"
"And the weapons of war perished"
After this David inquires of the Lord
"Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?"
The Lord: "Go up"
David: "To which shall I go up?"
"To Hebron"
David goes up there
His two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal
David brings up his men who are with him
Everyone with his household
They dwell in the towns of Hebron
The men of Judah come
They anoint David king over the house of Judah
They tell David
"It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul"
David sends messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead
"May you be blessed by the Lord"
"Because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord"
"And buried him"
"Now may the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you"
"And I will do good to you because you have done this thing"
"Now therefore let your hands be strong"
"Be valiant"
"For Saul your lord is dead"
"The house of Judah has anointed me king over them"
Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army
Takes Ish-bosheth the son of Saul
He brings him over to Mahanaim
He makes him king over Gilead, Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin
Over all Israel
Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, is forty years old when he begins to reign
He reigns two years
The house of Judah follows David
The time that David is king in Hebron over the house of Judah
Is seven years and six months
Abner and the servants of Ish-bosheth go out from Mahanaim to Gibeon
Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David go out
They meet them at the pool of Gibeon
They sit down, one on one side of the pool
The other on the other side
Abner: "Let the young men arise and compete before us"
Joab: "Let them arise"
They arise and pass over by number
Twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth
Twelve of the servants of David
Each catches his opponent by the head
He thrusts his sword in his opponent's side
They fall down together
That place is called Helkath-hazzurim
The battle is very fierce that day
Abner and the men of Israel are beaten before the servants of David
The three sons of Zeruiah are there
Joab, Abishai, and Asahel
Asahel is as swift of foot as a wild gazelle
Asahel pursues Abner
He turns neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner
Abner looks behind him
"Is it you, Asahel?"
"It is I"
Abner: "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left"
"Seize one of the young men and take his spoil"
Asahel will not turn aside from following him
Abner says again to Asahel
"Turn aside from following me"
"Why should I strike you to the ground?"
"How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?"
He refuses to turn aside
Abner strikes him in the stomach with the butt of his spear
The spear comes out at his back
He falls there and dies where he is
All who come to the place where Asahel has fallen and died, stand still
Joab and Abishai pursue Abner
As the sun is going down they come to the hill of Ammah
The Benjaminites gather themselves together behind Abner
They form a single group
They take their stand on the top of a hill
Abner calls to Joab
"Shall the sword devour forever?"
"Do you not know that the end will be bitter?"
"How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit?"
Joab: "As God lives, if you had not spoken"
"Surely the men would not have given up the pursuit until the morning"
Joab blows the trumpet
All the men stop
They pursue Israel no more
They do not fight anymore
Abner and his men go all that night through the Arabah
They cross the Jordan
They march the whole morning
They come to Mahanaim
Joab returns from the pursuit of Abner
When he has gathered all the people together
There are missing from David's servants nineteen men besides Asahel
The servants of David have struck down of Benjamin
360 of Abner's men
They take up Asahel
They bury him in the tomb of his father
Which is at Bethlehem
Joab and his men march all night
The day breaks upon them at Hebron
There is a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David
David grows stronger and stronger
The house of Saul becomes weaker and weaker
Sons are born to David at Hebron
His firstborn is Amnon, of Ahinoam of Jezreel
His second, Chileab, of Abigail the widow of Nabal
The third, Absalom the son of Maacah
The fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith
The fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital
The sixth, Ithream, of Eglah, David's wife
These are born to David in Hebron
While there is war between the house of Saul and the house of David
Abner is making himself strong in the house of Saul
Saul has a concubine whose name is Rizpah
Ish-bosheth says to Abner
"Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"
Abner is very angry over the words of Ish-bosheth
"Am I a dog's head of Judah?"
"To this day I keep showing steadfast love to the house of Saul"
"To his brothers, and to his friends"
"I have not given you into the hand of David"
"Yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman"
"God do so to Abner and more also"
"If I do not accomplish for David what the Lord has sworn to him"
"To transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul"
"To set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah"
"From Dan to Beersheba"
Ish-bosheth cannot answer Abner another word
Because he fears him
Abner sends messengers to David on his behalf
"To whom does the land belong?"
"Make your covenant with me"
"Behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel"
David: "Good; I will make a covenant with you"
"But one thing I require of you"
"You shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter"
"When you come to see my face"
David sends messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul's son
"Give me my wife Michal, for whom I paid the bride-price of a hundred foreskins"
Ish-bosheth sends and takes her from her husband Paltiel
Her husband goes with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahurim
Abner: "Go, return"
He returns
Abner confers with the elders of Israel
"For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you"
"Now then bring it about"
"For the Lord has promised David"
"'By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel'"
"'From the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies'"
Abner also speaks to Benjamin
Abner goes to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and Benjamin think good to do
When Abner comes with twenty men to David at Hebron
David makes a feast for Abner and the men who are with him
Abner says to David
"I will arise and go and will gather all Israel to my lord the king"
"That they may make a covenant with you"
"You may reign over all that your heart desires"
David sends Abner away
He goes in peace
Just then the servants of David arrive with Joab from a raid
Bringing much spoil with them
Abner is not with David at Hebron
For David has sent him away, and he has gone in peace
When Joab and all the army with him arrive
It is told Joab
"Abner the son of Ner came to the king"
"He has let him go, and he has gone in peace"
Joab goes to the king
"What have you done?"
"Behold, Abner came to you"
"Why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?"
"You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you"
"To know your going out and your coming in"
"To know all that you are doing"
When Joab comes out from David's presence
He sends messengers after Abner
They bring him back from the cistern of Sirah
David does not know about it
When Abner returns to Hebron
Joab takes him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately
There he strikes him in the stomach
He dies, for the blood of Asahel his brother
Afterward, when David hears of it
"I and my kingdom are forever guiltless before the Lord"
"For the blood of Abner the son of Ner"
"May it fall upon the head of Joab"
"And upon all his father's house"
"May the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge"
"Or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle"
"Or who falls by the sword, or who lacks bread"
Joab and Abishai his brother kill Abner
Because he has put their brother Asahel to death
David says to Joab and to all the people who are with him
"Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth"
"Mourn before Abner"
King David follows the bier
They bury Abner at Hebron
The king lifts up his voice and weeps at the grave of Abner
All the people weep
The king laments for Abner
"Should Abner die as a fool dies?"
"Your hands were not bound; your feet were not fettered"
"As one falls before the wicked you have fallen"
All the people weep again over him
All the people come to persuade David to eat bread
While it is yet day
David swears
"God do so to me and more also"
"If I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down"
All the people take notice of it
It pleases them
As everything that the king does pleases all the people
All the people and all Israel understand that day
That it has not been the king's will to put to death Abner
The king says to his servants
"Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?"
"And I am this day weak, though anointed king"
"These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are more severe than I"
"The Lord repay the evildoer according to his wickedness"
When Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, hears that Abner has died at Hebron
His courage fails
All Israel is dismayed
Saul's son has two men who are captains of raiding bands
The name of the one is Baanah
The name of the other Rechab
Sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Beeroth
For Beeroth also is counted as part of Benjamin
The Beerothites fled to Gittaim
They have been sojourners there to this day
Jonathan, the son of Saul, has a son who is crippled in his feet
He is five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan comes from Jezreel
His nurse takes him up and flees
As she flees in her haste, he falls and becomes lame
His name is Mephibosheth
The sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, set out
About the heat of the day they come to the house of Ish-bosheth
As he is taking his noonday rest
They come into the midst of the house
As if to get wheat
They strike him in the stomach
Rechab and Baanah his brother escape
When they come into the house, as he lies on his bed in his bedroom
They strike him and put him to death
They behead him
They take his head
They go by the way of the Arabah all night
They bring the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron
"Here is the head of Ish-bosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy"
"Who sought your life"
"The Lord has avenged my lord the king this day"
"On Saul and on his offspring"
David answers Rechab and Baanah
"As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity"
"When one told me, 'Behold, Saul is dead'"
"Thinking to bring good news"
"I seized him and killed him at Ziklag"
"Which was the reward I gave him for his news"
"How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous man"
"In his own house on his bed"
"Shall I not now require his blood at your hand"
"And destroy you from the earth?"
David commands his young men
They kill them
They cut off their hands and feet
They hang them beside the pool at Hebron
They take the head of Ish-bosheth
They bury it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron
All the tribes of Israel come to David at Hebron
"Behold, we are your bone and flesh"
"In times past, when Saul was king over us"
"It was you who led out and brought in Israel"
"The Lord said to you, 'You shall be shepherd of my people Israel'"
"'You shall be prince over Israel'"
All the elders of Israel come to the king at Hebron
King David makes a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord
They anoint David king over Israel
David is thirty years old when he begins to reign
He reigns forty years
At Hebron he reigns over Judah seven years and six months
At Jerusalem he reigns over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years
The king and his men go to Jerusalem against the Jebusites
The inhabitants of the land
They say to David, "You will not come in here"
"But the blind and the lame will ward you off"
Thinking, "David cannot come in here"
Nevertheless, David takes the stronghold of Zion
That is, the city of David
David says on that day
"Whoever would strike the Jebusites, let him get up the water shaft"
"To attack 'the lame and the blind'"
"Who are hated by David's soul"
Therefore it is said, "The blind and the lame shall not come into the house"
David dwells in the stronghold
He calls it the city of David
David builds the city all around from the Millo inward
David becomes greater and greater
For the Lord, the God of hosts, is with him
Hiram king of Tyre sends messengers to David
Cedar trees, also carpenters and masons
They build David a house
David knows that the Lord has established him king over Israel
That he has exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel
David takes more concubines and wives from Jerusalem
After he comes from Hebron
More sons and daughters are born to David
These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem
Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon
Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia
Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet
When the Philistines hear that David has been anointed king over Israel
All the Philistines go up to search for David
David hears of it
He goes down to the stronghold
The Philistines come and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim
David inquires of the Lord
"Shall I go up against the Philistines?"
"Will you give them into my hand?"
The Lord: "Go up, for I will certainly give the Philistines into your hand"
David comes to Baal-perazim
David defeats them there
"The Lord has broken through my enemies before me"
"Like a breaking flood"
Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim
The Philistines leave their idols there
David and his men carry them away
The Philistines come up yet again
They spread out in the Valley of Rephaim
When David inquires of the Lord
"You shall not go up"
"Go around to their rear"
"Come against them opposite the balsam trees"
"When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees"
"Then rouse yourself"
"For then the Lord has gone out before you"
"To strike down the army of the Philistines"
David does as the Lord commands him
He strikes down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer
David again gathers all the chosen men of Israel
Thirty thousand
David arises and goes with all the people who are with him
From Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God
Which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts
Who sits enthroned on the cherubim
They carry the ark of God on a new cart
They bring it out of the house of Abinadab
Which is on the hill
Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, are driving the new cart
They bring it out of the house of Abinadab with the ark of God
Ahio goes before the ark
David and all the house of Israel are celebrating before the Lord
With songs and lyres and harps and tambourines and castanets and cymbals
When they come to the threshing floor of Nacon
Uzzah puts out his hand to the ark of God
He takes hold of it
For the oxen stumble
The anger of the Lord is kindled against Uzzah
God strikes him down there because of his error
He dies there beside the ark of God
David is angry because the Lord has broken out against Uzzah
That place is called Perez-uzzah to this day
David is afraid of the Lord that day
"How can the ark of the Lord come to me?"
David is not willing to take the ark of the Lord into the city of David
David takes it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
The ark of the Lord remains in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite
Three months
The Lord blesses Obed-edom and all his household
It is told King David
"The Lord has blessed the household of Obed-edom"
"And all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God"
David goes and brings up the ark of God
From the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with rejoicing
When those who bear the ark of the Lord have gone six steps
He sacrifices an ox and a fattened animal
David dances before the Lord with all his might
David is wearing a linen ephod
David and all the house of Israel bring up the ark of the Lord
With shouting and with the sound of the horn
As the ark of the Lord comes into the city of David
Michal the daughter of Saul looks out of the window
She sees King David leaping and dancing before the Lord
She despises him in her heart
They bring in the ark of the Lord
They set it in its place, inside the tent that David has pitched for it
David offers burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord
When David finishes offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings
He blesses the people in the name of the Lord of hosts
He distributes among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel
Both men and women, a cake of bread, a portion of meat, a cake of raisins
All the people depart, each to his house
David returns to bless his household
Michal the daughter of Saul comes out to meet David
"How the king of Israel honored himself today"
"Uncovering himself today before the eyes of his servants' female servants"
"As one of the vulgar fellows shamelessly uncovers himself"
David says to Michal
"It was before the Lord, who chose me above your father"
"And above all his house, to appoint me as prince over Israel"
"The people of the Lord, and I will celebrate before the Lord"
"I will make myself yet more contemptible than this"
"I will be abased in your eyes"
"But by the female servants of whom you have spoken"
"By them I shall be held in honor"
Michal the daughter of Saul has no child to the day of her death
The king dwells in his house
The Lord has given him rest from all his surrounding enemies
The king says to Nathan the prophet
"See now, I dwell in a house of cedar"
"But the ark of God dwells in a tent"
Nathan says to the king
"Go, do all that is in your heart"
"For the Lord is with you"
That same night the word of the Lord comes to Nathan
"Go and tell my servant David"
"'Thus says the Lord: Would you build me a house to dwell in?'"
"I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel"
"From Egypt to this day"
"But I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling"
"In all places where I have moved with all the people of Israel"
"Did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel"
"Whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel"
"'Why have you not built me a house of cedar?'"
"Now, therefore, thus you shall say to my servant David"
"'Thus says the Lord of hosts'"
"'I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep'"
"'That you should be prince over my people Israel'"
"'I have been with you wherever you went'"
"'I have cut off all your enemies from before you'"
"'I will make for you a great name'"
"'Like the name of the great ones of the earth'"
"'I will appoint a place for my people Israel'"
"'I will plant them, so that they may dwell in their own place'"
"'And be disturbed no more'"
"'Violent men shall afflict them no more, as formerly'"
"'From the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel'"
"'I will give you rest from all your enemies'"
"'Moreover, the Lord declares to you'"
"'That the Lord will make you a house'"
"'When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers'"
"'I will raise up your offspring after you'"
"'Who shall come from your body'"
"'I will establish his kingdom'"
"'He shall build a house for my name'"
"'I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever'"
"'I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son'"
"'When he commits iniquity, I will discipline him'"
"'With the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men'"
"'But my steadfast love will not depart from him'"
"'As I took it from Saul, whom I put away from before you'"
"'Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me'"
"'Your throne shall be established forever'"
Nathan speaks to David according to all these words
According to all this vision
King David goes in and sits before the Lord
"Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house"
"That you have brought me thus far?"
"Yet this was a small thing in your eyes, O Lord God"
"You have spoken also of your servant's house for a great while to come"
"Is this instruction for mankind, O Lord God?"
"What more can David say to you?"
"For you know your servant, O Lord God"
"Because of your promise, and according to your own heart"
"You have brought about all this greatness"
"To make your servant know it"
"Therefore you are great, O Lord God"
"For there is none like you"
"There is no God besides you"
"According to all that we have heard with our ears"
"Who is like your people Israel"
"The one nation on earth whom God went to redeem"
"To be his people, making himself a name"
"Doing for them great and awesome things"
"By driving out before your people, whom you redeemed for yourself"
"Nations and their gods?"
"You established for yourself your people Israel to be your people forever"
"And you, O Lord, became their God"
"Now, O Lord God, confirm forever the word"
"That you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house"
"Do as you have spoken"
"Your name will be magnified forever"
"'The Lord of hosts is God over Israel'"
"And the house of your servant David will be established before you"
"For you, O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have made this revelation"
"'I will build you a house'"
"Therefore your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to you"
"Now, O Lord God, you are God"
"Your words are true"
"You have promised this good thing to your servant"
"Now therefore may it please you to bless the house of your servant"
"So that it may continue forever before you"
"For you, O Lord God, have spoken"
"With your blessing shall the house of your servant be blessed forever"

They besiege Rabbah
David remains at Jerusalem
Late one afternoon, David arises from his couch
He is walking on the roof of the king's house
From the roof he sees a woman bathing
The woman is very beautiful
David sends and inquires about the woman
"Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam?"
"The wife of Uriah the Hittite?"
David sends messengers and takes her
She comes to him
He lies with her
(Now she is purifying herself from her uncleanness)
She returns to her house
The woman conceives
She sends and tells David, "I am pregnant"
David sends word to Joab, "Send me Uriah the Hittite"
Joab sends Uriah to David
When Uriah comes to him, David asks
How Joab is doing and how the people are doing
How the war is going
David says to Uriah, "Go down to your house"
"Wash your feet"
Uriah goes out of the king's house
There follows him a present from the king
Uriah sleeps at the door of the king's house
With all the servants of his lord
He does not go down to his house
When they tell David, "Uriah did not go down to his house"
David says to Uriah
"Have you not come from a journey?"
"Why did you not go down to your house?"
Uriah says to David
"The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths"
"My lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field"
"Shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink"
"And to lie with my wife?"
"As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing"
David says to Uriah, "Remain here today also"
"Tomorrow I will send you back"
Uriah remains in Jerusalem that day and the next
David invites him
He eats in his presence and drinks
David makes him drunk
In the evening he goes out to lie on his couch
With the servants of his lord
He does not go down to his house
In the morning David writes a letter to Joab
He sends it by the hand of Uriah
In the letter he writes
"Set Uriah in the forefront of the hardest fighting"
"Then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die"
As Joab is besieging the city
He assigns Uriah to the place where he knows there are valiant men
The men of the city come out and fight with Joab
Some of the servants of David among the people fall
Uriah the Hittite also dies
Joab sends and tells David all the news about the fighting
He instructs the messenger
"When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king"
"Then, if the king's anger rises"
"And if he says to you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight?'"
"'Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?'"
"'Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth?'"
"'Did not a woman cast an upper millstone on him from the wall'"
"'So that he died at Thebez?'"
"'Why did you go so near the wall?'"
"Then you shall say, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also'"
The messenger goes
He comes and tells David all that Joab has sent him to tell
The messenger says to David
"The men gained an advantage over us"
"And came out against us in the field"
"But we drove them back to the entrance of the gate"
"Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall"
"Some of the king's servants are dead"
"Your servant Uriah the Hittite is dead also"
David says to the messenger
"Thus shall you say to Joab"
"'Do not let this matter displease you'"
"'For the sword devours now one and now another'"
"'Strengthen your attack against the city and overthrow it'"
"And encourage him"
When the wife of Uriah hears that Uriah her husband is dead
She mourns for her husband
When the mourning is over
David sends and brings her to his house
She becomes his wife
She bears him a son
The thing that David has done displeases the Lord
The Lord sends Nathan to David
He comes to him and says
"There were two men in a certain city"
"The one rich and the other poor"
"The rich man had very many flocks and herds"
"But the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb"
"Which he had bought"
"He brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children"
"It used to eat of his morsel and drink from his cup"
"And lie in his arms, and it was like a daughter to him"
"Now there came a traveler to the rich man"
"He was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd"
"To prepare for the guest who had come to him"
"But he took the poor man's lamb"
"And prepared it for the man who had come to him"
David's anger is greatly kindled against the man
"As the Lord lives, the man who has done this deserves to die"
"He shall restore the lamb fourfold"
"Because he did this thing, and because he had no pity"
Nathan says to David, "You are the man"
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'I anointed you king over Israel'"
"'I delivered you out of the hand of Saul'"
"'I gave you your master's house'"
"'Your master's wives into your arms'"
"'I gave you the house of Israel and of Judah'"
"'If this were too little, I would add to you as much more'"
"'Why have you despised the word of the Lord'"
"'To do what is evil in his sight?'"
"'You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword'"
"'Have taken his wife to be your wife'"
"'Have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites'"
"'Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house'"
"'Because you have despised me'"
"'Have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife'"
"'Thus says the Lord'"
"'Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house'"
"'I will take your wives before your eyes'"
"'Give them to your neighbor'"
"'He shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun'"
"'For you did it secretly'"
"'But I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun'"
David says to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord"
Nathan says to David, "The Lord also has put away your sin"
"You shall not die"
"Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord"
"The child who is born to you shall die"
Nathan goes to his house
The Lord afflicts the child that Uriah's wife bore to David
He becomes sick
David therefore seeks God on behalf of the child
David fasts
He goes in and lies all night on the ground
The elders of his house stand beside him
To raise him from the ground
He will not
Nor will he eat food with them
On the seventh day the child dies
The servants of David are afraid to tell him that the child is dead
"Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him"
"He did not listen to us"
"How then can we say to him the child is dead?"
"He may do himself some harm"
When David sees that his servants are whispering together
David understands that the child is dead
David says to his servants, "Is the child dead?"
"He is dead"
David arises from the earth
He washes and anoints himself
He changes his clothes
He goes into the house of the Lord
He worships
He then goes to his own house
When he asks, they set food before him
He eats
His servants: "What is this thing that you have done?"
"You fasted and wept for the child while he was alive"
"But when the child died, you arose and ate food"
"While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept"
"For I said, 'Who knows whether the Lord will be gracious to me'"
"'That the child may live?'"
"But now he is dead"
"Why should I fast?"
"Can I bring him back again?"
"I shall go to him, but he will not return to me"
David comforts his wife, Bathsheba
He goes in to her
He lies with her
She bears a son
He calls his name Solomon
The Lord loves him
He sends a message by Nathan the prophet
He calls his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord
Joab fights against Rabbah of the Ammonites
He takes the royal city
Joab sends messengers to David
"I have fought against Rabbah"
"Moreover, I have taken the city of waters"
"Now then gather the rest of the people together"
"Encamp against the city and take it"
"Lest I take the city, and it be called by my name"
David gathers all the people together
He goes to Rabbah
He fights against it
He takes it
He takes the crown of their king from his head
The weight of it is a talent of gold
In it is a precious stone
It is placed on David's head
He brings out the spoil of the city, a very great amount
He brings out the people who are in it
He sets them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes
He makes them toil at the brick kilns
Thus he does to all the cities of the Ammonites
David and all the people return to Jerusalem
After this, Absalom the son of David has a beautiful sister
Whose name is Tamar
Amnon the son of David loves her
Amnon is so tormented that he makes himself ill
Because of his sister Tamar
For she is a virgin
It seems impossible to Amnon to do anything to her
Amnon has a friend, whose name is Jonadab
The son of Shimeah, David's brother
Jonadab is a very crafty man
"O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning?"
"Will you not tell me?"
Amnon: "I love Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister"
Jonadab: "Lie down on your bed and pretend to be ill"
"When your father comes to see you, say to him"
"'Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat'"
"'Let her prepare the food in my sight'"
"'That I may see it and eat it from her hand'"
Amnon lies down and pretends to be ill
When the king comes to see him
Amnon says to the king
"Please let my sister Tamar come"
"Let her make a couple of cakes in my sight"
"That I may eat from her hand"
David sends home to Tamar
"Go to your brother Amnon's house"
"Prepare food for him"
Tamar goes to her brother Amnon's house
Where he is lying down
She takes dough and kneads it
She makes cakes in his sight
She bakes the cakes
She takes the pan and empties it out before him
He refuses to eat
Amnon: "Send out everyone from me"
Everyone goes out from him
Amnon says to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber"
"That I may eat from your hand"
Tamar takes the cakes she has made
She brings them into the chamber to Amnon her brother
When she brings them near him to eat
He takes hold of her
"Come, lie with me, my sister"
"No, my brother, do not violate me"
"For such a thing is not done in Israel"
"Do not do this outrageous thing"
"As for me, where could I carry my shame?"
"And as for you, you would be as one of the outrageous fools in Israel"
"Now therefore, please speak to the king"
"For he will not withhold me from you"
He will not listen to her
Being stronger than she
He violates her
He lies with her
Amnon hates her with very great hatred
So that the hatred with which he hates her is greater
Than the love with which he had loved her
Amnon: "Get up! Go!"
"No, my brother, for this wrong in sending me away"
"Is greater than the other that you did to me"
He will not listen to her
He calls the young man who served him
"Put this woman out of my presence"
"Bolt the door after her"
(Now she is wearing a long robe with sleeves
For thus were the virgin daughters of the king dressed)
His servant puts her out
He bolts the door after her
Tamar puts ashes on her head
She tears the long robe that she wears
She lays her hand on her head
She goes away, crying aloud as she goes
Her brother Absalom says to her
"Has Amnon your brother been with you?"
"Now hold your peace, my sister"
"He is your brother; do not take this to heart"
Tamar dwells, a desolate woman, in her brother Absalom's house
When King David hears of all these things
He is very angry
Absalom speaks to Amnon neither good nor bad
For Absalom hates Amnon
Because he has violated his sister Tamar
After two full years Absalom has sheepshearers at Baal-hazor
Absalom invites all the king's sons
Absalom comes to the king
"Behold, your servant has sheepshearers"
"Please let the king and his servants go with your servant"
The king: "No, my son, let us not all go"
"Lest we be burdensome to you"
He presses him, but he will not go
He gives him his blessing
Absalom: "If not, please let my brother Amnon go with us"
The king: "Why should he go with you?"
Absalom presses him until he lets Amnon and all the king's sons go
Absalom makes a feast like a king's feast
Absalom commands his servants
"Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine"
"When I say to you, 'Strike Amnon,' then kill him"
"Do not fear; have not I commanded you?"
"Be courageous and be valiant"
The servants of Absalom do to Amnon as Absalom has commanded
All the king's sons arise
Each mounts his mule and flees
While they are on the way, news comes to David
"Absalom has struck down all the king's sons"
"Not one of them is left"
The king arises
He tears his garments
He lies on the earth
All his servants who are standing by tear their garments
Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David's brother, says
"Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men, the king's sons"
"For Amnon alone is dead"
"For by the command of Absalom this has been determined"
"From the day he violated his sister Tamar"
"Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart"
"As to suppose that all the king's sons are dead"
"For Amnon alone is dead"
Absalom has fled
The young man who kept the watch lifts up his eyes and looks
Behold, many people are coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain
Jonadab says to the king
"Behold, the king's sons have come"
"As your servant said, so it has come about"
As soon as he has finished speaking
Behold, the king's sons come
They lift up their voice and weep
The king also and all his servants weep very bitterly
Absalom fled and went to Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur
David mourns for his son day after day
Absalom flees and goes to Geshur
He is there three years
The spirit of the king longs to go out to Absalom
Because he is comforted about Amnon, since he is dead
Joab the son of Zeruiah perceives that the king's heart goes out to Absalom
Joab sends to Tekoa and brings from there a wise woman
He says to her, "Pretend to be a mourner"
"Put on mourning garments"
"Do not anoint yourself with oil"
"But behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead"
"Go to the king and speak thus to him"
Joab puts the words in her mouth
When the woman of Tekoa comes to the king
She falls on her face to the ground
She prostrates herself
"Save me, O king"
The king: "What is your trouble?"
"Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead"
"Your servant had two sons"
"They quarreled with one another in the field"
"There was no one to separate them"
"One struck the other and killed him"
"Now the whole clan has risen against your servant"
"They say, 'Give up the man who struck his brother'"
"'That we may put him to death for the life of his brother'"
"'Thus they would destroy the heir also'"
"Thus they would quench my coal that is left"
"And leave to my husband neither name nor remnant on the face of the earth"
The king: "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you"
The woman of Tekoa: "On me be the guilt, my lord the king"
"And on my father's house"
"Let the king and his throne be guiltless"
The king: "If anyone says anything to you"
"Bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again"
"Please let the king invoke the Lord your God"
"That the avenger of blood kill no more"
"That my son be not destroyed"
"As the Lord lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground"
"Please let your servant speak a word to my lord the king"
"Speak"
"Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God?"
"For in giving this decision the king convicts himself"
"Inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again"
"We must all die; we are like water spilled on the ground"
"Which cannot be gathered up again"
"But God will not take away life"
"He will devise plans so that the banished one will not remain an outcast"
"Now I have come to say this to my lord the king"
"Because the people have made me afraid"
"Your servant thought, 'I will speak to the king'"
"'It may be that the king will perform the request of his servant'"
"'For the king will hear and deliver his servant'"
"'From the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together'"
"'From the heritage of God'"
"Your servant thought, 'The word of my lord the king will set me at rest'"
"For my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil"
"The Lord your God be with you"
The king answers the woman
"Do not hide from me anything I ask you"
The woman: "Let my lord the king speak"
"Is the hand of Joab with you in all this?"
The woman: "As surely as you live, my lord the king"
"One cannot turn to the right hand or to the left"
"From anything that my lord the king has said"
"It was your servant Joab who commanded me"
"It was he who put all these words in the mouth of your servant"
"In order to change the course of things your servant Joab did this"
"But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God"
"To know all things that are on the earth"
The king says to Joab, "Behold now, I grant this"
"Go, bring back the young man Absalom"
Joab falls on his face to the ground
He prostrates himself
He blesses the king
Joab: "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight"
"My lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant"
Joab arises and goes to Geshur
He brings Absalom to Jerusalem
The king: "Let him dwell apart in his own house"
"He is not to come into my presence"
Absalom dwells apart in his own house
He does not come into the king's presence
Now in all Israel there is no one so much to be praised for his handsome appearance
From the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there is no blemish in him
When he cuts the hair of his head
(For at the end of every year he used to cut it)
(When it was heavy on him, he cut it)
He weighs the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight
There are born to Absalom three sons, and one daughter whose name is Tamar
She is a beautiful woman
Absalom dwells two full years in Jerusalem
Without coming into the king's presence
Absalom sends for Joab, to send him to the king
Joab will not come to him
He sends a second time, but Joab will not come
Absalom says to his servants
"See, Joab's field is next to mine"
"He has barley there; go and set it on fire"
Absalom's servants set the field on fire
Joab arises and goes to Absalom at his house
"Why have your servants set my field on fire?"
Absalom: "Behold, I sent word to you, 'Come here'"
"'That I may send you to the king, to ask'"
"'Why have I come from Geshur?'"
"'It would be better for me to be there still'"
"Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king"
"If there is guilt in me, let him put me to death"
Joab goes to the king and tells him
The king summons Absalom
He comes to the king
He bows himself on his face to the ground before the king
The king kisses Absalom
After this Absalom gets himself a chariot and horses
Fifty men to run before him
Absalom used to rise early
He would stand beside the way of the gate
When any man had a dispute to come before the king for judgment
Absalom would call to him
"From what city are you?"
When he says, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel"
Absalom: "See, your claims are good and right"
"But there is no man designated by the king to hear you"
"Oh that I were judge in the land"
"That every man with a dispute or cause might come to me"
"And I would give him justice"
Whenever a man came near to prostrate himself before him
He would put out his hand and take hold of him
He would kiss him
Thus Absalom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment
Absalom steals the hearts of the men of Israel
At the end of four years Absalom says to the king
"Please let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the Lord, in Hebron"
"For your servant vowed a vow while I lived at Geshur in Syria"
"'If the Lord will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem'"
"'Then I will offer worship to the Lord'"
The king: "Go in peace"
He arises and goes to Hebron
Absalom sends secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel
"As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet"
"Then say, 'Absalom is king at Hebron'"
With Absalom go two hundred men from Jerusalem
Who are invited guests
They go in their innocence and know nothing
While Absalom is offering the sacrifices
He sends for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor
From his city Giloh
The conspiracy grows strong
The people with Absalom keep increasing
A messenger comes to David
"The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Absalom"
David says to all his servants who are with him at Jerusalem
"Arise, and let us flee"
"Or else there will be no escape for us from Absalom"
"Go quickly, lest he overtake us quickly"
"And bring down ruin on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword"
The king's servants: "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord chooses"
The king goes out
All his household after him
The king leaves ten concubines to keep the house
The king goes out
All the people after him
They halt at the last house
All his servants pass by him
All the Cherethites, all the Pelethites
All the six hundred Gittites who have followed him from Gath
Pass on before the king
The king says to Ittai the Gittite
"Why do you also go with us?"
"Go back and stay with the king"
"For you are a foreigner and also an exile from your home"
"You came only yesterday"
"Should I today make you wander about with us"
"Since I go I know not where?"
"Go back and take your brothers with you"
"May the Lord show steadfast love and faithfulness to you"
Ittai: "As the Lord lives, and as my lord the king lives"
"Wherever my lord the king shall be"
"Whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be"
David: "Go then, pass on"
Ittai the Gittite passes on with all his men
And all the little ones who are with him
All the land weeps aloud as all the people pass by
The king crosses the brook Kidron
All the people pass on toward the wilderness
Abiathar comes up
Behold, Zadok also comes
With all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God
They set down the ark of God
Until the people have all passed out of the city
The king says to Zadok
"Carry the ark of God back into the city"
"If I find favor in the eyes of the Lord"
"He will bring me back and let me see both it and his dwelling place"
"But if he says, 'I have no pleasure in you'"
"Behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him"
The king also says to Zadok the priest
"Are you not a seer?"
"Go back to the city in peace"
"With your two sons, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar"
"See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness"
"Until word comes from you to inform me"
Zadok and Abiathar carry the ark of God back to Jerusalem
They remain there
David goes up the ascent of the Mount of Olives
Weeping as he goes, barefoot and with his head covered
All the people who are with him cover their heads
They go up, weeping as they go
It is told David, "Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom"
David: "O Lord, please turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness"
When David comes to the summit
Where God is worshiped
Behold, Hushai the Archite comes to meet him
With his coat torn and dirt on his head
David says to him
"If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me"
"But if you return to the city and say to Absalom"
"'I will be your servant, O king'"
"'As I have been your father's servant in time past'"
"'So now I will be your servant'"
"Then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel"
"Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there?"
"So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abiathar"
"Behold, their two sons are with them there"
"Ahimaaz, Zadok's son, and Jonathan, Abiathar's son"
"By them you shall send to me everything you hear"
Hushai, David's friend, comes into the city
Just as Absalom is entering Jerusalem
When David has passed a little beyond the summit
Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth meets him
With a couple of donkeys saddled
Bearing two hundred loaves of bread
A hundred bunches of raisins
A hundred of summer fruits
And a skin of wine
The king: "Why have you brought these?"
Ziba: "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride on"
"The bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat"
"The wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink"
The king: "Where is your master's son?"
Ziba: "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem"
"For he said, 'Today the house of Israel will give me back'"
"'The kingdom of my father'"
The king: "Behold, all that belonged to Mephibosheth is now yours"
Ziba: "I pay homage; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king"
When King David comes to Bahurim
There comes out a man of the family of the house of Saul
Whose name is Shimei, the son of Gera
He comes out cursing continually
He throws stones at David and at all the servants of King David
All the people and all the mighty men are on his right hand and on his left
Shimei says as he curses, "Get out, get out, you man of blood"
"You worthless man"
"The Lord has avenged on you all the blood of the house of Saul"
"In whose place you have reigned"
"The Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom"
"See, your evil is on you, for you are a man of blood"
Abishai the son of Zeruiah says to the king
"Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?"
"Let me go over and take off his head"
The king: "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah?"
"If he is cursing because the Lord has said to him, 'Curse David'"
"Who then shall say, 'Why have you done so?'"
David says to Abishai and to all his servants
"Behold, my own son seeks my life"
"How much more now may this Benjaminite"
"Leave him alone, and let him curse"
"For the Lord has told him to"
"It may be that the Lord will look on the wrong done to me"
"That the Lord will repay me with good for his cursing today"
David and his men go on the road
While Shimei goes along on the hillside opposite him
Cursing as he goes and throwing stones at him
And flinging dust
The king, and all the people who are with him, arrive weary
At the Jordan
There he refreshes himself
Absalom, and all the people, the men of Israel, come to Jerusalem
Ahithophel with him
When Hushai the Archite, David's friend, comes to Absalom
Hushai says to Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"
Absalom: "Is this your loyalty to your friend?"
"Why did you not go with your friend?"
Hushai: "No, for whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel choose"
"His I will be, and with him I will remain"
"And again, whom should I serve?"
"Should it not be his son?"
"As I have served your father, so I will serve you"
Absalom says to Ahithophel
"Give your counsel"
"What shall we do?"
Ahithophel says to Absalom
"Go in to your father's concubines"
"Whom he has left to keep the house"
"When all Israel hears that you have made yourself a stench to your father"
"Then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened"
They pitch a tent for Absalom on the roof
Absalom goes in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel
Now in those days the counsel that Ahithophel gives
Is as if one consulted the word of God
So is all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed
Both by David and by Absalom
Ahithophel says to Absalom
"Let me choose twelve thousand men"
"I will arise and pursue David tonight"
"I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged"
"I will throw him into a panic"
"All the people who are with him will flee"
"I will strike down only the king"
"I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband"
"You seek the life of only one man"
"All the people will be at peace"
The advice seems right to Absalom and all the elders of Israel
Absalom: "Call Hushai the Archite also"
"Let us hear what he has to say"
When Hushai comes to Absalom
Absalom tells him what Ahithophel has said
"Shall we do as he says?"
"If not, you speak"
Hushai says to Absalom
"This time the counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good"
Hushai says, "You know that your father and his men are mighty men"
"They are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field"
"Besides, your father is expert in war"
"He will not spend the night with the people"
"Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits or in some other place"
"As soon as some of the people fall at the first attack"
"Whoever hears it will say, 'There has been a slaughter among the people'"
"Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion"
"Will utterly melt with fear"
"For all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man"
"Those who are with him are valiant men"
"But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you"
"From Dan to Beersheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude"
"That you go to battle in person"
"So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found"
"We shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground"
"Of him and all the men with him not one will be left"
"If he withdraws into a city"
"Then all Israel will bring ropes to that city"
"We shall drag it into the valley"
"Until not even a pebble is to be found there"
Absalom and all the men of Israel say
"The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better"
"Than the counsel of Ahithophel"
For the Lord has ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel
So that the Lord may bring harm upon Absalom
Hushai tells Zadok and Abiathar the priests
"Thus and so did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders"
"Thus and so have I counseled"
"Now therefore send quickly and tell David"
"'Do not stay tonight at the fords of the wilderness'"
"'But by all means pass over'"
"'Lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up'"
Jonathan and Ahimaaz are waiting at En-rogel
A female servant is to go and tell them
They are to go and tell King David
For they must not be seen entering the city
A young man sees them and tells Absalom
They both go away quickly
They come to the house of a man at Bahurim
Who has a well in his courtyard
They go down into it
The woman takes and spreads a covering over the well's mouth
She scatters grain on it
Nothing is known of it
When Absalom's servants come to the woman at the house
"Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?"
The woman: "They have gone over the brook of water"
When they have sought and do not find them
They return to Jerusalem
After they have gone, the men come up out of the well
They go and tell King David
"Arise, and go quickly over the water"
"For thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you"
David arises, and all the people who are with him
They cross the Jordan
By daybreak not one is left who has not crossed the Jordan
When Ahithophel sees that his counsel is not followed
He saddles his donkey
He goes off home to his own city
He sets his house in order
He hangs himself
He dies and is buried in the tomb of his father
David comes to Mahanaim
Absalom crosses the Jordan with all the men of Israel
Absalom sets Amasa over the army instead of Joab
Amasa is the son of a man named Ithra the Ishmaelite
Who has married Abigal the daughter of Nahash
Sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother
Israel and Absalom encamp in the land of Gilead
When David comes to Mahanaim
Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites
Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar
Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim
Bring beds, basins, and earthen vessels
Wheat, barley, flour, parched grain, beans and lentils
Honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd
For David and the people with him to eat
For they say, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness"
David musters the men who are with him
He sets over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
David sends out the army
One third under the command of Joab
One third under the command of Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother
One third under the command of Ittai the Gittite
The king says to the men
"I myself will also go out with you"
The men: "You shall not go out"
"For if we flee, they will not care about us"
"If half of us die, they will not care about us"
"But you are worth ten thousand of us"
"Therefore it is better that you send us help from the city"
The king: "Whatever seems best to you I will do"
The king stands at the side of the gate
While all the army marches out by hundreds and by thousands
The king commands Joab and Abishai and Ittai
"Deal gently for my sake with the young man Absalom"
All the people hear when the king gives orders to all the commanders
About Absalom
The army goes out into the field against Israel
The battle is fought in the forest of Ephraim
The men of Israel are defeated there by the servants of David
The loss there is great on that day
Twenty thousand men
The battle spreads over the face of all the country
The forest devours more people that day than the sword
Absalom happens to meet the servants of David
Absalom is riding on his mule
The mule goes under the thick branches of a great oak
His head catches fast in the oak
He is suspended between heaven and earth
While the mule that is under him goes on
A certain man sees it
He tells Joab, "Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak"
Joab: "What, you saw him!"
"Why then did you not strike him there to the ground?"
"I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a belt"
The man: "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver"
"I would not reach out my hand against the king's son"
"For in our hearing the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai"
"'For my sake protect the young man Absalom'"
"On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life"
"And there is nothing hidden from the king"
"Then you yourself would have stood aloof"
Joab: "I will not waste time like this with you"
He takes three javelins in his hand
He thrusts them into the heart of Absalom
While he is still alive in the oak
Ten young men, Joab's armor-bearers, surround Absalom
They strike him and kill him
Joab blows the trumpet
The troops come back from pursuing Israel
For Joab restrained them
They take Absalom
They cast him into a great pit in the forest
They raise over him a very great heap of stones
All Israel flees every one to his own home
Now Absalom in his lifetime has taken and set up for himself the pillar
Which is in the King's Valley
For he says, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance"
He calls the pillar after his own name
It is called Absalom's monument to this day
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok says
"Let me run and carry news to the king"
"That the Lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies"
Joab: "You are not to carry news today"
"You may carry news another day"
"But today you shall carry no news"
"Because the king's son is dead"
Joab says to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen"
The Cushite bows before Joab, and runs
Ahimaaz the son of Zadok says again to Joab
"Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite"
Joab: "Why will you run, my son"
"Seeing that you will have no reward for the news?"
"Come what may, I will run"
"Run"
Ahimaaz runs by the way of the plain
He outstrips the Cushite
David is sitting between the two gates
The watchman goes up to the roof of the gate by the wall
He lifts up his eyes and looks
He sees a man running alone
The watchman calls out and tells the king
The king: "If he is alone, there is news in his mouth"
He comes nearer and nearer
The watchman sees another man running
The watchman calls to the gate
"See, another man running alone"
The king: "He also brings news"
The watchman: "I think the running of the first is like the running of Ahimaaz"
The king: "He is a good man and comes with good news"
Ahimaaz cries out to the king, "All is well"
He prostrates himself before the king with his face to the earth
"Blessed be the Lord your God"
"Who has delivered up the men who raised their hand against my lord the king"
The king: "Is it well with the young man Absalom?"
Ahimaaz: "When Joab sent your servant"
"I saw a great tumult, but I do not know what it was"
The king: "Turn aside and stand here"
He turns aside and stands still
The Cushite comes
The Cushite: "Good news for my lord the king"
"For the Lord has delivered you this day"
"From the hand of all who rose up against you"
The king: "Is it well with the young man Absalom?"
The Cushite: "May the enemies of my lord the king"
"And all who rise up against you for evil"
"Be like that young man"
The king is deeply moved
He goes up to the chamber over the gate
He weeps
As he goes, he says
"O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom"
"Would I had died instead of you"
"O Absalom, my son, my son"
It is told Joab, "Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom"
The victory that day is turned into mourning for all the people
For the people hear that day
"The king is grieving for his son"
The people steal into the city that day
As people steal in who are ashamed when they flee in battle
The king covers his face
The king cries with a loud voice
"O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son"
Joab comes into the house to the king
"You have today covered with shame the faces of all your servants"
"Who have this day saved your life"
"And the lives of your sons and your daughters"
"And the lives of your wives and your concubines"
"Because you love those who hate you"
"And hate those who love you"
"For you have made it clear today that commanders and servants are nothing"
"For today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead today"
"Then you would be pleased"
"Now therefore arise, go out and speak kindly to your servants"
"For I swear by the Lord, if you do not go"
"Not a man will stay with you this night"
"This will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you"
"From your youth until now"
The king arises and takes his seat in the gate
They tell all the people
"Behold, the king is sitting in the gate"
All the people come before the king
Now Israel has fled every man to his own home
All the people are arguing throughout all the tribes of Israel
"The king delivered us from the hand of our enemies"
"He saved us from the hand of the Philistines"
"Now he has fled out of the land from Absalom"
"But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle"
"Now therefore why do you say nothing about bringing the king back?"
King David sends this message to Zadok and Abiathar the priests
"Say to the elders of Judah"
"'Why should you be the last to bring the king back to his house?'"
"'The talk of all Israel has come to the king'"
"'You are my brothers; you are my bone and my flesh'"
"'Why then should you be the last to bring back the king?'"
"And say to Amasa"
"'Are you not my bone and my flesh?'"
"'God do so to me and more also'"
"'If you are not commander of my army from now on in place of Joab'"
He sways the heart of all the men of Judah as one man
They send word to the king
"Return, both you and all your servants"
The king comes back to the Jordan
Judah comes to Gilgal to meet the king
To bring the king over the Jordan
Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, from Bahurim
Hurries to come down with the men of Judah to meet King David
With him are a thousand men from Benjamin
Ziba the servant of the house of Saul, with his fifteen sons
And his twenty servants
They rush to the Jordan before the king
They cross the ford to bring over the king's household
To do his pleasure
Shimei the son of Gera falls down before the king
As he is about to cross the Jordan
He says to the king
"Let not my lord hold me guilty"
"Or remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem"
"Do not let the king take it to heart"
"For your servant knows that I have sinned"
"Therefore, behold, I have come this day"
"The first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king"
Abishai the son of Zeruiah answers
"Shall not Shimei be put to death for this"
"Because he cursed the Lord's anointed?"
David: "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah?"
"That you should this day be as an adversary to me?"
"Shall anyone be put to death in Israel this day?"
"For do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?"
The king says to Shimei, "You shall not die"
The king gives him his oath
Mephibosheth the son of Saul comes down to meet the king
He has neither taken care of his feet
Nor trimmed his beard
Nor washed his clothes
From the day the king departed until the day he came back in safety
When he comes to Jerusalem to meet the king
The king: "Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?"
"My lord, O king, my servant deceived me"
"For your servant said, 'I will saddle a donkey for myself'"
"'That I may ride on it and go with the king'"
"For your servant is lame"
"He has slandered your servant to my lord the king"
"But my lord the king is like the angel of God"
"Do therefore what seems good to you"
"For all my father's house were but men doomed to death before my lord the king"
"But you set your servant among those who eat at your table"
"What further right have I, then, to cry to the king?"
The king: "Why speak any more of your affairs?"
"I have decided: you and Ziba shall divide the land"
Mephibosheth: "Oh, let him take it all"
"Since my lord the king has come safely home"
Barzillai the Gileadite has come down from Rogelim
He goes on with the king to the Jordan
To escort him over the Jordan
Barzillai is a very aged man, eighty years old
He has provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim
For he is a very wealthy man
The king says to Barzillai
"Come over with me, and I will provide for you with me in Jerusalem"
Barzillai: "How many years have I still to live"
"That I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?"
"I am this day eighty years old"
"Can I discern what is pleasant and what is not?"
"Can your servant taste what he eats or what he drinks?"
"Can I still listen to the voice of singing men and singing women?"
"Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king?"
"Your servant will go a little way over the Jordan with the king"
"Why should the king repay me with such a reward?"
"Please let your servant return"
"That I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and my mother"
"But here is your servant Chimham"
"Let him go over with my lord the king"
"Do for him whatever seems good to you"
The king: "Chimham shall go over with me"
"I will do for him whatever seems good to you"
"Whatever you desire of me, I will do for you"
All the people go over the Jordan
The king goes over
The king kisses Barzillai and blesses him
He returns to his own home
The king goes on to Gilgal
Chimham goes on with him
All the people of Judah, and also half the people of Israel
Bring the king on his way
Behold, all the men of Israel come to the king
"Why have our brothers the men of Judah stolen you away"
"And brought the king and his household over the Jordan"
"And all David's men with him?"
All the men of Judah answer the men of Israel
"Because the king is our close relative"
"Why then are you angry over this matter?"
"Have we eaten at all at the king's expense?"
"Or has he given us any gift?"
The men of Israel answer the men of Judah
"We have ten shares in the king"
"In David also we have more than you"
"Why then did you despise us?"
"Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?"
The words of the men of Judah are fiercer than the words of the men of Israel
There happens to be there a worthless man, whose name is Sheba
The son of Bichri, a Benjaminite
He blows the trumpet
"We have no portion in David"
"We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse"
"Every man to his tents, O Israel"
All the men of Israel withdraw from David
They follow Sheba the son of Bichri
The men of Judah follow their king steadfastly
From the Jordan to Jerusalem
David comes to his house at Jerusalem
The king takes the ten concubines whom he has left to care for the house
He puts them in a house under guard
He provides for them
But does not go in to them
They are shut up until the day of their death
Living as if in widowhood
The king says to Amasa
"Call the men of Judah together to me within three days"
"And be here yourself"
Amasa goes to summon Judah
He delays beyond the set time that David has appointed him
David says to Abishai
"Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom"
"Take your lord's servants and pursue him"
"Lest he get himself to fortified cities and escape from us"
Joab's men go out after him
The Cherethites and the Pelethites
All the mighty men
They go out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
When they are at the great stone that is in Gibeon
Amasa comes to meet them
Joab is wearing a soldier's garment
Over it is a belt with a sword in its sheath fastened on his thigh
As he goes forward it falls out
Joab says to Amasa, "Is it well with you, my brother?"
Joab takes Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him
Amasa does not observe the sword that is in Joab's hand
Joab strikes him with it in the stomach
He pours out his entrails to the ground
Without striking a second blow, he dies
Joab and Abishai his brother pursue Sheba the son of Bichri
One of Joab's young men takes his stand by Amasa
"Whoever favors Joab, and whoever is for David, let him follow Joab"
Amasa lies wallowing in his blood in the highway
When the man sees that all the people stop
He carries Amasa out of the highway into the field
He throws a garment over him
When he is taken out of the highway
All the people go on after Joab to pursue Sheba
Sheba passes through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah
All the Bichrites assemble and follow him in
They come and besiege him in Abel of Beth-maacah
They cast up a mound against the city
It stands against the rampart
They are battering the wall to throw it down
A wise woman calls from the city
"Listen! Listen! Tell Joab, 'Come here, that I may speak to you'"
He comes near her
The woman: "Are you Joab?"
"I am"
"Listen to the words of your servant"
"I am listening"
"They used to say in former times"
"'Let them but ask counsel at Abel,' and so they settled a matter"
"I am one of those who are peaceable and faithful in Israel"
"You seek to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel"
"Why will you swallow up the heritage of the Lord?"
Joab: "Far be it from me, far be it"
"That I should swallow up or destroy"
"That is not true"
"A man of the hill country of Ephraim, called Sheba the son of Bichri"
"Has lifted up his hand against King David"
"Give up him alone, and I will withdraw from the city"
The woman: "Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall"
The woman goes to all the people in her wisdom
They cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri
They throw it out to Joab
He blows the trumpet
They disperse from the city, every man to his home
Joab returns to Jerusalem to the king
Joab is in command of all the army of Israel
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada is in command of the Cherethites and the Pelethites
Adoram is in charge of the forced labor
Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud is the recorder
Sheva is secretary
Zadok and Abiathar are priests
Ira the Jairite is also David's priest
Now there is a famine in the days of David for three years
Year after year
David seeks the face of the Lord
The Lord: "There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house"
"Because he put the Gibeonites to death"
The king calls the Gibeonites and speaks to them
(Now the Gibeonites are not of the people of Israel
But of the remnant of the Amorites
Although the people of Israel have sworn to spare them
Saul has sought to strike them down in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah)
David says to the Gibeonites
"What shall I do for you?"
"How shall I make atonement, that you may bless the heritage of the Lord?"
The Gibeonites: "It is not a matter of silver or gold between us and Saul"
"Or his house"
"Neither is it for us to put any man to death in Israel"
"What do you say that I shall do for you?"
"Let seven of his sons be given to us"
"So that we may hang them before the Lord at Gibeah of Saul"
"The chosen of the Lord"
The king: "I will give them"
The king spares Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan
Because of the oath of the Lord that was between them
Between David and Jonathan the son of Saul
The king takes the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah
Whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth
The five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul
Whom she bore to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite
He gives them into the hands of the Gibeonites
They hang them on the mountain before the Lord
The seven of them perish together
They are put to death in the first days of harvest
At the beginning of barley harvest
Rizpah the daughter of Aiah takes sackcloth
She spreads it for herself on the rock
From the beginning of harvest until rain falls upon them from the heavens
She does not allow the birds of the air to come upon them by day
Or the beasts of the field by night
When David is told what Rizpah has done
David goes and takes the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan
From the men of Jabesh-gilead, who have stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan
Where the Philistines have hanged them, on the day the Philistines killed Saul on Gilboa
He brings up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of his son Jonathan
They gather the bones of those who were hanged
They bury the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan
In the land of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father
They do all that the king commands
After that God heeds the plea for the land
There is war again between the Philistines and Israel
David goes down together with his servants
They fight against the Philistines
David grows weary
Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giants
Whose spear weighs three hundred shekels of bronze
Is armed with a new sword
He thinks to kill David
Abishai the son of Zeruiah comes to his aid
He attacks the Philistine and kills him
Then David's men swear to him
"You shall no longer go out with us to battle"
"Lest you quench the lamp of Israel"
After this there is again war with the Philistines at Gob
Sibbecai the Hushathite strikes down Saph
Who is one of the descendants of the giants
There is again war with the Philistines at Gob
Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, the Bethlehemite
Strikes down Goliath the Gittite
The shaft of whose spear is like a weaver's beam
There is again war at Gath
There is a man of great stature
Who has six fingers on each hand, and six toes on each foot
Twenty-four in number
He also is descended from the giants
When he taunts Israel
Jonathan the son of Shimei, David's brother, strikes him down
These four are descended from the giants in Gath
They fall by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants
David speaks to the Lord the words of this song
On the day when the Lord delivers him from the hand of all his enemies
And from the hand of Saul
"The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer"
"My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge"
"My shield, and the horn of my salvation"
"My stronghold and my refuge, my savior"
"You save me from violence"
"I call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised"
"So I shall be saved from my enemies"
(The song continues)
These are the last words of David
The oracle of David, the son of Jesse
The oracle of the man who was raised on high
The anointed of the God of Jacob
The sweet psalmist of Israel
"The Spirit of the Lord speaks by me"
"His word is on my tongue"
"The God of Israel has spoken"
"The Rock of Israel has said to me"
"'When one rules justly over men'"
"'Ruling in the fear of God'"
"'He dawns on them like the morning light'"
"'Like the sun shining forth on a cloudless morning'"
"'Like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth'"
"For does not my house stand so with God?"
"For he has made with me an everlasting covenant"
"Ordered in all things and secure"
"For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?"
"But worthless men are all like thorns that are thrown away"
"For they cannot be taken with the hand"
"But the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear"
"And they are utterly consumed with fire"
These are the names of the mighty men whom David has
Josheb-basshebeth a Tahchemonite
He is chief of the three
He wields his spear against eight hundred whom he kills at one time
Next to him among the three mighty men is Eleazar the son of Dodo
He is with David when they defy the Philistines
Who are gathered there for battle
The men of Israel withdraw
He rises and strikes down the Philistines until his hand is weary
His hand clings to the sword
The Lord brings about a great victory that day
The men return after him only to strip the slain
Next to him is Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite
The Philistines gather at Lehi
Where there is a plot of ground full of lentils
The men flee from the Philistines
He takes his stand in the midst of the plot
He defends it and strikes down the Philistines
The Lord works a great victory
Three of the thirty chief men go down
They come about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam
A band of Philistines is encamped in the Valley of Rephaim
David is then in the stronghold
The garrison of the Philistines is then at Bethlehem
David says longingly, "Oh, that someone would give me water to drink"
"From the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate"
The three mighty men break through the camp of the Philistines
They draw water out of the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate
They carry it and bring it to David
He will not drink of it
He pours it out to the Lord
"Far be it from me, O Lord, that I should do this"
"Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?"
Therefore he will not drink it
These things the three mighty men do
Abishai, the brother of Joab, is chief of the thirty
He wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them
He won a name beside the three
He is the most renowned of the thirty
He becomes their commander
But he does not attain to the three
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada is a valiant man of Kabzeel
A doer of great deeds
He strikes down two ariels of Moab
He also goes down and strikes down a lion in a pit on a day when snow has fallen
He strikes down an Egyptian, a handsome man
The Egyptian has a spear in his hand
Benaiah goes down to him with a staff
He snatches the spear out of the Egyptian's hand
He kills him with his own spear
These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada does
He wins a name beside the three mighty men
He is renowned among the thirty
But he does not attain to the three
David sets him over his bodyguard
(A list of the thirty follows, including Asahel, Uriah the Hittite, and others)
Again the anger of the Lord is kindled against Israel
He incites David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah"
The king says to Joab, the commander of the army, who is with him
"Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba"
"Number the people, that I may know the number of the people"
Joab: "May the Lord your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are"
"While the eyes of my lord the king still see it"
"But why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"
The king's word prevails against Joab and the commanders of the army
Joab and the commanders of the army go out from the presence of the king
To number the people of Israel
They cross the Jordan
They begin from Aroer, and from the city that is in the middle of the valley
Toward Gad and on to Jazer
They come to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites
They come to Dan, and from Dan they go around to Sidon
They come to the fortress of Tyre
And to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites
They go out to the Negeb of Judah at Beersheba
When they have gone through all the land
They come to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days
Joab gives the sum of the numbering of the people to the king
In Israel there are 800,000 valiant men who draw the sword
The men of Judah are 500,000
David's heart strikes him after he has numbered the people
David says to the Lord, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done"
"But now, O Lord, please take away the iniquity of your servant"
"For I have done very foolishly"
When David arises in the morning
The word of the Lord comes to the prophet Gad, David's seer
"Go and say to David"
"'Thus says the Lord: Three things I offer you'"
"'Choose one of them, that I may do it to you'"
Gad comes to David and tells him
"Shall three years of famine come to you in your land?"
"Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you?"
"Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land?"
"Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me"
David: "I am in great distress"
"Let us fall into the hand of the Lord"
"For his mercy is great"
"But let me not fall into the hand of man"
The Lord sends a pestilence on Israel from the morning until the appointed time
From Dan to Beersheba 70,000 men die
When the angel stretches out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it
The Lord relents from the calamity
He says to the angel who is working destruction among the people
"It is enough; now stay your hand"
The angel of the Lord is by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite
David speaks to the Lord when he sees the angel who is striking the people
"Behold, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly"
"But these sheep, what have they done?"
"Please let your hand be against me and against my father's house"
Gad comes to David that day
"Go up, build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor of Araunah"
David goes up at Gad's word, as the Lord commands
When Araunah looks down, he sees the king and his servants coming
Araunah goes out and prostrates himself before the king with his face to the ground
Araunah: "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?"
David: "To buy the threshing floor from you"
"In order to build an altar to the Lord"
"That the plague may be averted from the people"
Araunah: "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him"
"Here are the oxen for the burnt offering"
"And the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood"
"All this, O king, Araunah gives to the king"
"May the Lord your God accept you"
The king: "No, but I will buy it from you for a price"
"I will not offer burnt offerings to the Lord my God that cost me nothing"
David buys the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver
David builds there an altar to the Lord
He offers burnt offerings and peace offerings
The Lord heeds the plea for the land
The plague is averted from Israel
King David is old and advanced in years
Although they cover him with clothes, he cannot get warm
His servants say to him
"Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king"
"Let her wait on the king and be in his service"
"Let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm"
They seek for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel
They find Abishag the Shunammite
They bring her to the king
The young woman is very beautiful
She becomes the king's servant and attends to him
The king knows her not
Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalts himself
"I will be king"
He prepares for himself chariots and horsemen
And fifty men to run before him
His father has never at any time displeased him by asking
"Why have you done thus and so?"
He is also a very handsome man
He is born next after Absalom
He confers with Joab the son of Zeruiah
And with Abiathar the priest
They follow Adonijah and help him
Zadok the priest, Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's mighty men
Are not with Adonijah
Adonijah sacrifices sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle
By the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-rogel
He invites all his brothers, the king's sons
And all the royal officials of Judah
He does not invite Nathan the prophet
Or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother
Nathan says to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon
"Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king?"
"David our lord does not know it"
"Now therefore come, let me give you advice"
"That you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon"
"Go in at once to King David"
"Say to him, 'Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant'"
"'Saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me"'"
"'"And he shall sit on my throne"?'"
"'Why then is Adonijah king?'"
"Then while you are still speaking with the king"
"I also will come in after you and confirm your words"
Bathsheba goes to the king in his chamber
(The king is very old, and Abishag the Shunammite is attending to the king)
Bathsheba bows and prostrates herself before the king
The king: "What do you desire?"
"My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God"
"'Solomon your son shall reign after me'"
"'"And he shall sit on my throne"'"
"And now, behold, Adonijah is king"
"Although you, my lord the king, do not know it"
"He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance"
"He has invited all the sons of the king"
"Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army"
"But Solomon your servant he has not invited"
"And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you"
"To tell them who shall sit on the throne after you"
"Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers"
"That I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders"
While she is still speaking with the king
Nathan the prophet comes in
They tell the king, "Here is Nathan the prophet"
When he comes in before the king
He prostrates himself before the king with his face to the ground
Nathan: "My lord the king, have you said, 'Adonijah shall reign after me'"
"'"And he shall sit on my throne"?'"
"For he has gone down this day"
"He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance"
"He has invited all the king's sons"
"Joab the commander of the army, and Abiathar the priest"
"Behold, they are eating and drinking before him"
"Saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!'"
"But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest"
"Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon"
"He has not invited"
"Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king"
"And you have not told your servants"
"Who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"
King David answers
"Call Bathsheba to me"
She comes into the king's presence
She stands before the king
The king swears
"As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity"
"As I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'Solomon your son shall reign after me'"
"'"And he shall sit on my throne in my place"'"
"Even so will I do this day"
Bathsheba bows with her face to the ground
She prostrates herself before the king
"May my lord King David live forever"
King David: "Call to me Zadok the priest"
"Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada"
They come before the king
The king says to them
"Take with you the servants of your lord"
"Have Solomon my son ride on my own mule"
"Bring him down to Gihon"
"Let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet"
"Anoint him there as king over Israel"
"Then blow the trumpet and say, 'Long live King Solomon!'"
"You shall then come up after him"
"He shall come and sit on my throne"
"For he shall be king in my place"
"I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah"
Benaiah: "Amen!"
"May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so"
"As the Lord has been with my lord the king"
"Even so may he be with Solomon"
"And make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David"
Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah
The Cherethites and the Pelethites go down
They have Solomon ride on King David's mule
They bring him to Gihon
Zadok the priest takes the horn of oil from the tent
He anoints Solomon
They blow the trumpet
All the people say, "Long live King Solomon!"
All the people go up after him
Playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy
So that the earth is split by their noise
Adonijah and all the guests who are with him hear it
As they finish feasting
When Joab hears the sound of the trumpet
"What does this uproar in the city mean?"
While he is still speaking
Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest comes
Adonijah: "Come in, for you are a worthy man"
"You bring good news"
Jonathan: "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king"
"The king has sent with him Zadok the priest"
"Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada"
"The Cherethites and the Pelethites"
"They have had him ride on the king's mule"
"Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon"
"They have gone up from there rejoicing"
"So that the city is in an uproar"
"This is the noise that you have heard"
"Solomon sits on the royal throne"
"Moreover, the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David"
"'May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours'"
"'"And make his throne greater than your throne"'"
"The king bowed himself on the bed"
"The king also said, 'Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel'"
"'"Who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day"'"
"'"My own eyes seeing it"'"
All the guests of Adonijah tremble
They rise, and each goes his own way
Adonijah fears Solomon
He arises and goes and takes hold of the horns of the altar
It is told Solomon
"Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon"
"Behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar"
"'Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death'"
Solomon: "If he will show himself a worthy man"
"Not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth"
"But if wickedness is found in him, he shall die"
King Solomon sends, and they bring him down from the altar
He comes and pays homage to King Solomon
Solomon: "Go to your house"
When David's time to die draws near
He commands Solomon his son
"I am about to go the way of all the earth"
"Be strong, and show yourself a man"
"Keep the charge of the Lord your God"
"Walking in his ways and keeping his statutes"
"His commandments, his rules, and his testimonies"
"As it is written in the Law of Moses"
"That you may prosper in all that you do"
"And wherever you turn"
"That the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me"
"'If your sons pay close attention to their way'"
"'"To walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul"'"
"'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel'"
"Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me"
"What he did to the two commanders of the armies of Israel"
"To Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether"
"Whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood shed in war"
"Putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist"
"And on the sandals on his feet"
"Act therefore according to your wisdom"
"Do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace"
"But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite"
"Let them be among those who eat at your table"
"For with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom"
"And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera"
"The Benjaminite from Bahurim"
"Who cursed me with a grievous curse"
"On the day when I went to Mahanaim"
"But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan"
"I swore to him by the Lord, 'I will not put you to death with the sword'"
"Now therefore do not hold him guiltless"
"For you are a wise man"
"You will know what you ought to do to him"
"You shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol"
David sleeps with his fathers
He is buried in the city of David
The time that David reigns over Israel is forty years
He reigns seven years in Hebron
And thirty-three years in Jerusalem
Solomon sits on the throne of David his father
His kingdom is firmly established
Adonijah the son of Haggith comes to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon
"Do you come peacefully?"
"Peacefully"
"I have something to say to you"
"Say on"
"You know that the kingdom was mine"
"All Israel fully expected me to reign"
"However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's"
"For it was his from the Lord"
"And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me"
"Say on"
"Please ask King Solomon to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife"
"He will not refuse you"
"Very well; I will speak to the king on your behalf"
Bathsheba goes to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah
The king rises to meet her
He bows down to her
He sits on his throne
He has a seat brought for the king's mother
She sits on his right
"I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me"
The king: "Make your request, my mother"
"For I will not refuse you"
"Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife"
King Solomon answers his mother
"Why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah?"
"Ask for him the kingdom also"
"For he is my older brother"
"Ask for him and for Abiathar the priest and for Joab the son of Zeruiah"
King Solomon swears by the Lord
"God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life"
"Now therefore as the Lord lives"
"Who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father"
"Who has made me a house, as he promised"
"Adonijah shall be put to death today"
King Solomon sends Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
He strikes him down, so that he dies
To Abiathar the priest the king says
"Go to Anathoth, to your estate"
"For you deserve death"
"But I will not at this time put you to death"
"Because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father"
"Because you shared in all my father's affliction"
Solomon removes Abiathar from being priest to the Lord
Thus fulfilling the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli
When the news comes to Joab
(For Joab has supported Adonijah, although he has not supported Absalom)
Joab flees to the tent of the Lord
He catches hold of the horns of the altar
It is told King Solomon, "Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord"
"Behold, he is beside the altar"
Solomon sends Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
"Go, strike him down"
Benaiah comes to the tent of the Lord
"The king commands, 'Come out'"
"No, I will die here"
Benaiah brings the king word again
"Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me"
The king: "Do as he has said"
"Strike him down and bury him"
"That you may remove from me and from my father's house"
"The guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause"
"The Lord will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head"
"Because, without the knowledge of my father David"
"He attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself"
"Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel"
"And Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah"
"So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab"
"And on the head of his descendants forever"
"But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne"
"There shall be peace from the Lord forevermore"
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada goes up
He strikes him down and puts him to death
He is buried in his own house in the wilderness
The king puts Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab
The king puts Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar
The king sends and summons Shimei
"Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there"
"Do not go out from there to any place whatever"
"For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron"
"Know for certain that you shall die"
"Your blood shall be on your own head"
Shimei: "What you say is good"
"As my lord the king has said, so will your servant do"
Shimei dwells in Jerusalem many days
At the end of three years, two of Shimei's servants run away
To Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath
It is told Shimei, "Behold, your servants are in Gath"
Shimei arises and saddles a donkey
He goes to Gath to Achish to seek his servants
Shimei goes and brings his servants from Gath
When Solomon is told that Shimei has gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned
The king sends and summons Shimei
"Did I not make you swear by the Lord?"
"Did I not solemnly warn you, saying, 'Know for certain that on the day you go out'"
"'"And go to any place whatever, you shall die"?'"
"You said to me, 'What you say is good; I will obey'"
"Why then have you not kept your oath to the Lord"
"And the commandment with which I commanded you?"
"You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father"
"The Lord will bring back your harm on your own head"
"But King Solomon shall be blessed"
"The throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever"
The king commands Benaiah the son of Jehoiada
He goes out and strikes him down, and he dies
The kingdom is established in the hand of Solomon
Solomon makes a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt
He takes Pharaoh's daughter
He brings her into the city of David
Until he has finished building his own house
And the house of the Lord
And the wall around Jerusalem
The people are sacrificing at the high places
Because no house has yet been built for the name of the Lord
Solomon loves the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father
Only, he sacrifices and makes offerings at the high places
The king goes to Gibeon to sacrifice there
For that is the great high place
Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar
At Gibeon the Lord appears to Solomon in a dream by night
God says, "Ask what I shall give you"
Solomon: "You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David"
"Because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness"
"And in uprightness of heart toward you"
"You have kept for him this great and steadfast love"
"You have given him a son to sit on his throne this day"
"And now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king"
"In place of David my father"
"Although I am but a little child"
"I do not know how to go out or come in"
"Your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen"
"A great people, too many to be numbered or counted"
"Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people"
"That I may discern between good and evil"
"For who is able to govern this your great people?"
It pleases the Lord that Solomon has asked this
God: "Because you have asked this"
"Have not asked for yourself long life"
"Or riches or the life of your enemies"
"But have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right"
"Behold, I now do according to your word"
"Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind"
"So that none like you has been before you"
"And none like you shall arise after you"
"I give you also what you have not asked"
"Both riches and honor"
"So that no other king shall compare with you, all your days"
"And if you will walk in my ways"
"Keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked"
"Then I will lengthen your days"
Solomon awakes, and behold, it is a dream
He comes to Jerusalem
He stands before the ark of the covenant of the Lord
He offers up burnt offerings and peace offerings
He makes a feast for all his servants
Two prostitutes come to the king
They stand before him
The one woman says, "Oh, my lord"
"This woman and I live in the same house"
"I gave birth to a child while she was in the house"
"Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth"
"We were alone"
"There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house"
"This woman's son died in the night"
"Because she lay on him"
"She arose at midnight"
"She took my son from beside me, while your servant slept"
"She laid him at her breast"
"And laid her dead son at my breast"
"When I rose in the morning to nurse my child"
"Behold, he was dead"
"But when I looked at him closely in the morning"
"Behold, he was not the child that I had borne"
The other woman: "No, the living child is mine"
"The dead child is yours"
The first: "No, the dead child is yours"
"The living child is mine"
Thus they speak before the king
The king: "The one says, 'This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead'"
"The other says, 'No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one'"
The king: "Bring me a sword"
They bring a sword before the king
The king: "Divide the living child in two"
"Give half to the one and half to the other"
The woman whose son is alive says to the king
(Because her heart yearns for her son)
"Oh, my lord, give her the living child"
"By no means put him to death"
The other: "He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him"
The king answers
"Give the living child to the first woman"
"Do not put him to death; she is his mother"
All Israel hears of the judgment that the king has rendered
They stand in awe of the king
Because they perceive that the wisdom of God is in him to do justice
King Solomon is king over all Israel
These are his high officials

Who provide food for the king and his household
Each man has to make provision for one month in the year
(The twelve officers and their districts are listed)
Judah and Israel are as many as the sand by the sea
They eat and drink and are happy
Solomon rules over all the kingdoms
From the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt
They bring tribute and serve Solomon all the days of his life
Solomon's provision for one day is
Thirty cors of fine flour
Sixty cors of meal
Ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle
A hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl

He has peace on all sides around him
Judah and Israel dwell in safety
From Dan even to Beersheba
Every man under his vine and under his fig tree
All the days of Solomon
Solomon also has 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots
And 12,000 horsemen
Those officers supply provisions for King Solomon
And for all who come to King Solomon's table
Each one in his month
They let nothing be lacking
Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds
They bring to the place where it is required
Each according to his duty
God gives Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure
And breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore
Solomon's wisdom surpasses the wisdom of all the people of the east
And all the wisdom of Egypt
He is wiser than all other men
Wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite
And Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol
His fame is in all the surrounding nations
He also speaks 3,000 proverbs
His songs are 1,005
He speaks of trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall
He speaks also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish
People of all nations come to hear the wisdom of Solomon
From all the kings of the earth, who have heard of his wisdom
Hiram king of Tyre sends his servants to Solomon
When he hears that they have anointed him king in place of his father
For Hiram always loved David
Solomon sends word to Hiram
"You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the Lord"
"Because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him"
"Until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet"
"But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side"
"There is neither adversary nor misfortune"
"And so I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God"
"As the Lord said to David my father"
"'Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place'"
"'Shall build the house for my name'"
"Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me"
"My servants will join your servants"
"I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set"
"For you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians"
When Hiram hears the words of Solomon, he rejoices greatly
"Blessed be the Lord this day"
"Who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people"
Hiram sends to Solomon
"I have heard the message that you have sent to me"
"I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber"
"My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon"
"I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct"
"I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it"
"And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household"
Hiram supplies Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desires
Solomon gives Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household
And 20,000 cors of beaten oil
Solomon gives this to Hiram year by year
The Lord gives Solomon wisdom, as he promised him
There is peace between Hiram and Solomon
The two of them make a treaty
King Solomon drafts forced labor out of all Israel
The draft numbers 30,000 men
He sends them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts
They are a month in Lebanon and two months at home
Adoniram is in charge of the draft
Solomon also has 70,000 burden-bearers
And 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country
Besides Solomon's 3,300 chief officers who are over the work
Who have charge of the people who carry on the work
At the king's command they quarry out great, costly stones
In order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones
Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders and the men of Gebal cut them
They prepare the timber and the stone to build the house
In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of Egypt
In the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel
In the month of Ziv, which is the second month
He begins to build the house of the Lord
The house that King Solomon builds for the Lord is sixty cubits long
Twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high
The vestibule in front of the nave of the house is twenty cubits long
Equal to the width of the house
And ten cubits deep in front of the house
For the house he makes windows with recessed frames
He also builds a structure against the wall of the house
Running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary
He makes side chambers all around
The lowest story is five cubits broad
The middle one is six cubits broad
The third is seven cubits broad
For around the outside of the house he makes offsets on the wall
In order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls
When the house is built, it is with stone prepared at the quarry
So that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron is heard in the house while it is being built
The entrance for the lowest story is on the south side of the house
One goes up by stairs to the middle story
And from the middle story to the third
He builds the house and finishes it
He makes the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar
He builds the structure against the whole house, five cubits high
It is joined to the house with timbers of cedar
Now the word of the Lord comes to Solomon
"Concerning this house that you are building"
"If you will walk in my statutes"
"And obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them"
"Then I will establish my word with you"
"Which I spoke to David your father"
"I will dwell among the children of Israel"
"I will not forsake my people Israel"
Solomon builds the house and finishes it
He lines the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar
From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling
He covers them on the inside with wood
He covers the floor of the house with boards of cypress
He builds twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar
From the floor to the walls
He builds this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place
The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, is forty cubits long
The cedar within the house is carved in the form of gourds and open flowers
All is cedar; no stone is seen
The inner sanctuary he prepares in the innermost part of the house
To set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord
The inner sanctuary is twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high
He overlays it with pure gold
He also overlays an altar of cedar
Solomon overlays the inside of the house with pure gold
He draws chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary
He overlays it with gold
The whole house he overlays with gold
Until all the house is finished
Also the whole altar that belongs to the inner sanctuary he overlays with gold
In the inner sanctuary he makes two cherubim of olivewood
Each ten cubits high
Five cubits is the length of one wing of the cherub
And five cubits the length of the other wing
Ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other
The other cherub also measures ten cubits
Both cherubim have the same measure and the same form
The height of one cherub is ten cubits
And so is that of the other cherub
He puts the cherubim in the innermost part of the house
The wings of the cherubim are spread out
So that a wing of one touches the one wall
And a wing of the other cherub touches the other wall
Their other wings touch each other in the middle of the house
He overlays the cherubim with gold
Around all the walls of the house he carves engraved figures of cherubim
And palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms
The floor of the house he overlays with gold in the inner and outer rooms
For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he makes doors of olivewood
The lintel and the doorposts form a pentagon
He covers the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers
He overlays them with gold
He spreads gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees
So also he makes for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood
In the form of a square
And two doors of cypress wood
The two leaves of the one door are folding
The two leaves of the other door are folding
On them he carves cherubim and palm trees and open flowers
He overlays them with gold evenly applied on the carved work
He builds the inner court with three courses of cut stone
And one course of cedar beams
In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord is laid
In the month of Ziv
In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month
The house is finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications
He is seven years in building it
Solomon builds his own house in thirteen years
And he finishes his entire house
He builds the House of the Forest of Lebanon
Its length is a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits
It is built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars
It is roofed with cedar above the chambers that are on the forty-five pillars
Fifteen in each row
There are window frames in three rows
Window opposite window in three tiers
All the doorways and windows have square frames
Window is opposite window in three tiers
He makes the Hall of Pillars
Its length is fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits
There is a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them
He makes the Hall of the Throne where he is to pronounce judgment
The Hall of Judgment
It is finished with cedar from floor to rafters
His own house where he is to dwell, in the other court back of the hall
Is of like workmanship
Solomon also makes a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter
Whom he has taken in marriage
All these are made of costly stones
Cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front
Even from the foundation to the coping
And from the outside to the great court
The foundation is of costly stones, huge stones
Stones of eight and ten cubits
Above are costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar
The great court has three courses of cut stone all around
And a course of cedar beams
So has the inner court of the house of the Lord
And the vestibule of the house
King Solomon sends and brings Hiram from Tyre
He is the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali
His father is a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze
He is full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze
He comes to King Solomon and does all his work
He casts two pillars of bronze
Eighteen cubits is the height of one pillar
A line of twelve cubits measures its circumference
It is hollow, and its thickness is four fingers
The second pillar is the same
He also makes two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars
The height of the one capital is five cubits
The height of the other capital is five cubits
There are lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals
On the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other
He makes pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework
To cover the capital that is on the top of the pillar
He does the same with the other capital
Now the capitals that are on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule are of lily-work
Four cubits
The capitals are on the two pillars
And also above the rounded projection which is beside the latticework
There are two hundred pomegranates, in two rows all around
And so with the other capital
He sets up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple
He sets up the pillar on the south and calls its name Jachin
He sets up the pillar on the north and calls its name Boaz
On the tops of the pillars is lily-work
Thus the work of the pillars is finished
He makes the sea of cast metal
It is round, ten cubits from brim to brim
And five cubits high
A line of thirty cubits measures its circumference
Under its brim are gourds, for ten cubits
Compassing the sea all around
The gourds are in two rows, cast with it when it is cast
It stands on twelve oxen
Three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, three facing east
The sea is set on them
All their rear parts are inward
Its thickness is a handbreadth
Its brim is made like the brim of a cup
Like the flower of a lily
It holds two thousand baths
He also makes the ten stands of bronze
Each stand is four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high
This is the construction of the stands
They have panels, and the panels are set in the frames
On the panels that are set in the frames are lions, oxen, and cherubim
On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen
There are wreaths of beveled work
Moreover, each stand has four bronze wheels and axles of bronze
At the four corners are supports for a basin
The supports are cast with wreaths at the side of each
Its opening is within a crown that projects upward one cubit
Its opening is round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep
At its opening there are carvings
And its panels are square, not round
The four wheels are underneath the panels
The axles of the wheels are of one piece with the stands
The height of a wheel is a cubit and a half
The wheels are made like a chariot wheel
Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs are all cast
There are four supports at the four corners of each stand
The supports are of one piece with the stands
On the top of the stand there is a round band half a cubit high
On the top of the stand its stays and its panels are of one piece with it
On the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carves cherubim, lions, and palm trees
According to the space of each, with wreaths all around
After this manner he makes the ten stands
All of them are cast alike, of the same measure and the same form
He makes ten basins of bronze
Each basin holds forty baths
Each basin measures four cubits
There is a basin for each of the ten stands
He sets the stands, five on the south side of the house
And five on the north side of the house
He sets the sea on the southeast corner of the house
Hiram also makes the pots, the shovels, and the basins
Hiram finishes all the work that he does for King Solomon on the house of the Lord
The two pillars
The two bowls of the capitals that are on the tops of the pillars
The two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals on the tops of the pillars
The four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks
Two rows of pomegranates for each latticework
To cover the two bowls of the capitals on the pillars
The ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands
The one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea
Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels
That Hiram makes for King Solomon for the house of the Lord
Are of burnished bronze
In the plain of the Jordan the king casts them
In the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan
Solomon leaves all the vessels unweighed
Because there are so many of them
The weight of the bronze is not ascertained
Solomon makes all the vessels that are in the house of the Lord
The golden altar
The golden table for the bread of the Presence
The lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north
Before the inner sanctuary
The flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold
The cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold
The sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place
And for the doors of the nave of the temple
Thus all the work that King Solomon does on the house of the Lord is finished
Solomon brings in the things that David his father has dedicated
The silver, the gold, and the vessels
He stores them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord
Solomon assembles the elders of Israel
And all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel
Before King Solomon in Jerusalem
To bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion
All the men of Israel assemble to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim
Which is the seventh month
All the elders of Israel come
The priests take up the ark
They bring up the ark of the Lord
The tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that are in the tent
The priests and the Levites bring them up
King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who have assembled before him
Are with him before the ark
Sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they cannot be counted or numbered
The priests bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place
In the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place
Underneath the wings of the cherubim
For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark
The cherubim overshadow the ark and its poles
The poles are so long that the ends of the poles are seen from the Holy Place
Before the inner sanctuary
But they cannot be seen from outside
They are there to this day
There is nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone
That Moses put there at Horeb
Where the Lord makes a covenant with the people of Israel
When they come out of the land of Egypt
When the priests come out of the Holy Place
A cloud fills the house of the Lord
The priests are not able to stand to minister because of the cloud
For the glory of the Lord fills the house of the Lord
Solomon says, "The Lord has said that he would dwell in thick darkness"
"I have indeed built you an exalted house"
"A place for you to dwell in forever"
The king turns around and blesses all the assembly of Israel
While all the assembly of Israel stands
"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel"
"Who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth"
"To David my father, saying"
"'Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt'"
"'I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house'"
"'That my name might be there'"
"'But I chose David to be over my people Israel'"
"Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house"
"For the name of the Lord, the God of Israel"
"But the Lord said to David my father"
"'Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name'"
"'You did well that it was in your heart'"
"'Nevertheless, you shall not build the house'"
"'But your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name'"
"Now the Lord has fulfilled his promise that he made"
"For I have risen in the place of David my father"
"I sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised"
"I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel"
"There I have provided a place for the ark"
"In which is the covenant of the Lord"
"That he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt"
Solomon stands before the altar of the Lord
In the presence of all the assembly of Israel
He spreads out his hands toward heaven
"O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you"
"In heaven above or on earth beneath"
"Keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants"
"Who walk before you with all their heart"
(Solomon's prayer continues at length)
"But will God indeed dwell on the earth?"
"Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you"
"How much less this house that I have built"
"Hear in heaven your dwelling place"
"When you hear, forgive"
(Solomon lists various situations where Israel will need God's forgiveness)
"If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence"
"Or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar"
"If their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates"
"Whatever plague, whatever sickness there is"
"Whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man"
"Or by all your people Israel"
"Each knowing the affliction of his own heart"
"And stretching out his hands toward this house"
"Then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive"
"Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel"
"Comes from a far country for your name's sake"
"When he comes and prays toward this house"
"Hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all"
"For which the foreigner calls to you"
"If your people go out to battle against their enemy"
"By whatever way you shall send them"
"And they pray to the Lord toward the city that you have chosen"
"And the house that I have built for your name"
"Then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea"
"And maintain their cause"
"If they sin against you—for there is no one who does not sin—"
"And you are angry with them and give them to an enemy"
"So that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy"
"Far off or near"
"Yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive"
"And repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying"
"'We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly'"
"If they repent with all their heart and with all their soul"
"In the land of their enemies, who carried them captive"
"And pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers"
"The city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name"
"Then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea"
"And maintain their cause"
"And forgive your people who have sinned against you"
"For they are your people, and your heritage"
"Which you brought out of Egypt"
"From the midst of the iron furnace"
Solomon finishes offering all this prayer and plea to the Lord
He arises from before the altar of the Lord
Where he has knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven
He stands and blesses all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice
"Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel"
"According to all that he promised"
"Not one word has failed of all his good promise"
"Which he spoke by Moses his servant"
"The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers"
"May he not leave us or forsake us"
"That he may incline our hearts to him"
"To walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments"
"His statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers"
"Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the Lord"
"Be near to the Lord our God day and night"
"That he may maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel"
"As each day requires"
"That all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God"
"There is no other"
"Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the Lord our God"
"Walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day"
The king, and all Israel with him, offer sacrifice before the Lord
Solomon offers as peace offerings to the Lord 22,000 oxen
And 120,000 sheep
So the king and all the people of Israel dedicate the house of the Lord
The same day the king consecrates the middle of the court
That is before the house of the Lord
For there he offers the burnt offering and the grain offering
And the fat pieces of the peace offerings
Because the bronze altar that is before the Lord is too small
To receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces
Solomon holds the feast at that time
And all Israel with him, a great assembly
From Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt
Before the Lord our God, seven days
On the eighth day he sends the people away
They bless the king and go to their homes
Joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord has shown to David
And to Israel his people
As soon as Solomon has finished building the house of the Lord
And the king's house and all that Solomon desires to build
The Lord appears to Solomon a second time
As he has appeared to him at Gibeon
The Lord says to him
"I have heard your prayer and your plea"
"Which you have made before me"
"I have consecrated this house that you have built"
"By putting my name there forever"
"My eyes and my heart will be there for all time"
"And as for you, if you will walk before me"
"As David your father walked"
"With integrity of heart and uprightness"
"Doing according to all that I have commanded you"
"And keeping my statutes and my rules"
"Then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever"
"As I promised David your father, saying"
"'You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel'"
"But if you turn aside from following me"
"You or your children"
"And do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you"
"But go and serve other gods and worship them"
"Then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them"
"And the house that I have consecrated for my name"
"I will cast out of my sight"
"And Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples"
"And this house will become a heap of ruins"
"Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss"
"And they will say, 'Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?'"
"Then they will say, 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God'"
"'Who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt'"
"'And laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them'"
"'Therefore the Lord has brought all this disaster on them'"
At the end of twenty years
In which Solomon has built the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king's house
Hiram king of Tyre has supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber
And gold, as much as he desires
King Solomon gives to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee
Hiram comes from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon has given him
They do not please him
"What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother?"
They are called the land of Cabul to this day
Hiram has sent to the king 120 talents of gold
This is the account of the forced labor
That King Solomon drafts to build the house of the Lord
And his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem
And Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer
(Pharaoh king of Egypt has gone up and captured Gezer
He burns it with fire
He kills the Canaanites who dwell in the city
He gives it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife)
Solomon rebuilds Gezer
And Lower Beth-horon
And Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah
And all the store cities that Solomon has
And the cities for his chariots
And the cities for his horsemen
And whatever Solomon desires to build
In Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion
All the people who are left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites
The Hivites, and the Jebusites, who are not of the people of Israel
Their descendants who are left after them in the land
Whom the people of Israel are unable to devote to destruction
These Solomon drafts to be slaves
And so they are to this day
But of the people of Israel Solomon makes no slaves
They are the soldiers
They are his officials, his commanders, his captains
His chariot commanders and his horsemen
These are the chief officers who are over Solomon's work
550 who have charge of the people who carry on the work
Pharaoh's daughter goes up from the city of David
To her own house that Solomon has built for her
Then he builds the Millo
Three times a year Solomon offers burnt offerings and peace offerings
On the altar that he builds to the Lord
Making offerings with it before the Lord
So he finishes the house
King Solomon builds a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber
Which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom
Hiram sends with the fleet his servants, seamen who are familiar with the sea
Together with the servants of Solomon
They go to Ophir
They bring from there gold, 420 talents
They bring it to King Solomon
Now when the queen of Sheba hears of the fame of Solomon
Concerning the name of the Lord
She comes to test him with hard questions
She comes to Jerusalem with a very great retinue
With camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones
When she comes to Solomon
She tells him all that is on her mind
Solomon answers all her questions
There is nothing hidden from the king that he cannot explain to her
When the queen of Sheba has seen all the wisdom of Solomon
The house that he has built
The food of his table, the seating of his officials
The attendance of his servants, their clothing
His cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offers at the house of the Lord
There is no more breath in her
She says to the king
"The report was true that I heard in my own land"
"Of your words and of your wisdom"
"But I did not believe the reports until I came"
"And my own eyes had seen it"
"And behold, the half was not told me"
"Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard"
"Happy are your men! Happy are your servants"
"Who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom"
"Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you"
"And set you on the throne of Israel"
"Because the Lord loved Israel forever"
"He has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness"
She gives the king 120 talents of gold
A very great quantity of spices and precious stones
Never again comes such an abundance of spices
As these that the queen of Sheba gives to King Solomon
Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which brings gold from Ophir
Brings from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones
The king makes of the almug wood supports for the house of the Lord
And for the king's house, also lyres and harps for the singers
No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day
King Solomon gives to the queen of Sheba all that she desires
Whatever she asks besides what is given her by the bounty of King Solomon
She turns and goes back to her own land with her servants
Now the weight of gold that comes to Solomon in one year
Is 666 talents of gold
Besides that which comes from the explorers
And from the business of the merchants
And from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land
King Solomon makes 200 large shields of beaten gold
600 shekels of gold go into each shield
He makes 300 shields of beaten gold
Three minas of gold go into each shield
The king puts them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon
The king also makes a great ivory throne
He overlays it with the finest gold
The throne has six steps
The throne has a round top
On each side of the seat are armrests
Two lions standing beside the armrests
Twelve lions stand there, one on each end of a step on the six steps
Nothing like it has ever been made in any kingdom
All King Solomon's drinking vessels are of gold
All the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon are of pure gold
None is of silver; silver is not considered as anything in the days of Solomon
For the king has a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram
Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish comes
Bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks
Thus King Solomon excels all the kings of the earth
In riches and in wisdom
The whole earth seeks the presence of Solomon
To hear his wisdom, which God has put into his mind
Every one of them brings his present
Articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules
So much year by year
Solomon gathers together chariots and horsemen
He has 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen
Whom he stations in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem
The king makes silver as common in Jerusalem as stone
He makes cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah
Solomon's import of horses is from Egypt and Kue
The king's traders receive them from Kue at a price
A chariot is imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver
A horse for 150
Likewise through them these are exported to all the kings of the Hittites
And the kings of Syria
Now King Solomon loves many foreign women
Along with the daughter of Pharaoh
Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women
From the nations concerning which the Lord has said to the people of Israel
"You shall not enter into marriage with them"
"Neither shall they with you"
"For surely they will turn away your heart after their gods"
Solomon clings to these in love
He has 700 wives, who are princesses
And 300 concubines
His wives turn away his heart
When Solomon is old his wives turn away his heart after other gods
His heart is not wholly true to the Lord his God
As was the heart of David his father
Solomon goes after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians
And after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites
Solomon does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
He does not wholly follow the Lord, as David his father has done
Then Solomon builds a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab
And for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites
On the mountain east of Jerusalem
He does the same for all his foreign wives
Who make offerings and sacrifice to their gods
The Lord is angry with Solomon
Because his heart has turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel
Who has appeared to him twice
And has commanded him concerning this thing
That he should not go after other gods
He has not kept what the Lord commanded
Therefore the Lord says to Solomon
"Since this has been your practice"
"And you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you"
"I will surely tear the kingdom from you"
"And will give it to your servant"
"Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days"
"But I will tear it out of the hand of your son"
"However, I will not tear away all the kingdom"
"But I will give one tribe to your son"
"For the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen"
The Lord raises up an adversary against Solomon
Hadad the Edomite
He is of the royal house in Edom
(When David is in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army goes up
To bury the slain
He strikes down every male in Edom
For Joab and all Israel remain there six months
Until he has cut off every male in Edom
But Hadad flees to Egypt
Together with certain Edomites of his father's servants, Hadad still being a little child
They set out from Midian and come to Paran
They take men with them from Paran and come to Egypt
To Pharaoh king of Egypt
Who gives him a house and assigns him an allowance of food
And gives him land
Hadad finds great favor in the sight of Pharaoh
So that he gives him in marriage the sister of his own wife
The sister of Tahpenes the queen
The sister of Tahpenes bears him Genubath his son
Tahpenes weans him in Pharaoh's house
Genubath is in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh
When Hadad hears in Egypt that David sleeps with his fathers
And that Joab the commander of the army is dead
Hadad says to Pharaoh, "Let me depart, that I may go to my own country"
Pharaoh: "What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go?"
"Nothing; only let me depart")
God also raises up as an adversary to him Rezon the son of Eliada
Who has fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah
He gathers men about him and becomes leader of a marauding band
After the killing by David
They go to Damascus and dwell there
They make him king in Damascus
He is an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon
Doing harm as Hadad does
He loathes Israel and reigns over Syria
Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah
A servant of Solomon, whose mother's name is Zeruah, a widow
Also lifts up his hand against the king
This is the reason why he lifts up his hand against the king
Solomon builds the Millo
He closes up the breach of the city of David his father
The man Jeroboam is very able
Solomon sees that the young man is industrious
He gives him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph
At that time, when Jeroboam goes out of Jerusalem
The prophet Ahijah the Shilonite finds him on the road
Ahijah has dressed himself in a new garment
The two of them are alone in the open country
Ahijah lays hold of the new garment that is on him
He tears it into twelve pieces
He says to Jeroboam
"Take for yourself ten pieces"
"For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon'"
"'I will give you ten tribes'"
"'But he shall have one tribe'"
"'For the sake of my servant David'"
"'And for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen'"
"'Out of all the tribes of Israel'"
"'Because they have forsaken me'"
"'And worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians'"
"'Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites'"
"'And they have not walked in my ways'"
"'Doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules'"
"'As David his father did'"
"'Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand'"
"'But I will make him ruler all the days of his life'"
"'For the sake of David my servant whom I chose'"
"'Who kept my commandments and my statutes'"
"'But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand'"
"'And I will give it to you, ten tribes'"
"'Yet to his son I will give one tribe'"
"'That David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem'"
"'The city where I have chosen to put my name'"
"'And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires'"
"'You shall be king over Israel'"
"'And if you will listen to all that I command you'"
"'And will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes'"
"'By keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did'"
"'I will be with you and will build you a sure house'"
"'As I built for David, and I will give Israel to you'"
"'And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this'"
"'But not forever'"
Solomon seeks therefore to kill Jeroboam
Jeroboam arises and flees into Egypt
To Shishak king of Egypt
He is in Egypt until the death of Solomon
Now the rest of the acts of Solomon
And all that he did, and his wisdom
Are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon?
The time that Solomon reigns in Jerusalem over all Israel is forty years
Solomon sleeps with his fathers
He is buried in the city of David his father
Rehoboam his son reigns in his place
Rehoboam goes to Shechem
For all Israel has come to Shechem to make him king
When Jeroboam the son of Nebat hears of it
(For he is still in Egypt, where he has fled from King Solomon)
Jeroboam returns from Egypt
They send and call him
Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel come
They say to Rehoboam
"Your father made our yoke heavy"
"Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father"
"And his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you"
He says to them, "Go away for three days, then come again to me"
The people go away
King Rehoboam takes counsel with the old men
Who have stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived
"How do you advise me to answer this people?"
They say to him
"If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them"
"And speak good words to them when you answer them"
"Then they will be your servants forever"
He abandons the counsel that the old men give him
He takes counsel with the young men who have grown up with him
Who stand before him
"What do you advise that we answer this people"
"Who have said to me, 'Lighten the yoke that your father put on us'?"
The young men who have grown up with him say to him
"Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you"
"'Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us'"
"Thus shall you say to them"
"'My little finger is thicker than my father's thighs'"
"'And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke'"
"'I will add to your yoke'"
"'My father disciplined you with whips'"
"'But I will discipline you with scorpions'"
Jeroboam and all the people come to Rehoboam the third day
As the king says, "Come to me again the third day"
The king answers the people harshly
He abandons the counsel that the old men have given him
He speaks to them according to the counsel of the young men
"My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke"
"My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions"
The king does not listen to the people
For it is a turn of affairs brought about by the Lord
That he might fulfill his word
Which the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat
When all Israel sees that the king does not listen to them
The people answer the king
"What portion do we have in David?"
"We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse"
"To your tents, O Israel"
"Look now to your own house, David"
Israel goes to their tents
Rehoboam reigns over the people of Israel who dwell in the cities of Judah
King Rehoboam sends Adoram, who is taskmaster over the forced labor
All Israel stones him to death with stones
King Rehoboam makes haste to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem
Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day
When all Israel hears that Jeroboam has returned
They send and call him to the assembly
They make him king over all Israel
There is none that follows the house of David but the tribe of Judah only
When Rehoboam comes to Jerusalem
He assembles all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin
180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel
To restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon
The word of God comes to Shemaiah the man of God
"Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah"
"And to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people"
"'Thus says the Lord, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives'"
"'The people of Israel. Every man return to his home'"
"'For this thing is from me'"
They listen to the word of the Lord
They go home again, according to the word of the Lord
Jeroboam builds Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim
He dwells there
He goes out from there and builds Penuel
Jeroboam says in his heart
"Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David"
"If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem"
"Then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord"
"To Rehoboam king of Judah"
"They will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah"
The king takes counsel
He makes two calves of gold
He says to the people, "You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough"
"Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt"
He sets one in Bethel
The other he puts in Dan
This thing becomes a sin
The people go as far as Dan to be before one
He also makes temples on high places
He appoints priests from among all the people
Who are not of the Levites
Jeroboam appoints a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month
Like the feast that is in Judah
He offers sacrifices on the altar
So he does in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he makes
He places in Bethel the priests of the high places that he has made
He goes up to the altar that he has made in Bethel
On the fifteenth day in the eighth month
In the month that he has devised from his own heart
He institutes a feast for the people of Israel
He goes up to the altar to make offerings
Behold, a man of God comes out of Judah by the word of the Lord to Bethel
Jeroboam is standing by the altar to make offerings
The man cries against the altar by the word of the Lord
"O altar, altar, thus says the Lord"
"'Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name'"
"'He shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places'"
"'Who make offerings on you'"
"'And human bones shall be burned on you'"
He gives a sign the same day
"This is the sign that the Lord has spoken"
"'Behold, the altar shall be torn down'"
"'And the ashes that are on it shall be poured out'"
When the king hears the saying of the man of God
Which he cries against the altar at Bethel
Jeroboam stretches out his hand from the altar
"Seize him"
His hand, which he stretches out against him, dries up
So that he cannot draw it back to himself
The altar also is torn down
The ashes are poured out from the altar
According to the sign that the man of God has given by the word of the Lord
The king says to the man of God
"Entreat now the favor of the Lord your God"
"And pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me"
The man of God entreats the Lord
The king's hand is restored to him
It becomes as it was before
The king says to the man of God
"Come home with me, and refresh yourself"
"I will give you a reward"
The man of God says to the king
"If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you"
"I will not eat bread or drink water in this place"
"For so was it commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying"
"'You shall neither eat bread nor drink water'"
"'Nor return by the way that you came'"
He goes another way
He does not return by the way that he came to Bethel
An old prophet dwells in Bethel
His sons come and tell him all that the man of God has done that day in Bethel
They tell their father the words that he has spoken to the king
Their father says to them, "Which way did he go?"
His sons show him the way that the man of God who came from Judah has gone
He says to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me"
They saddle the donkey for him
He rides after him
He finds him sitting under an oak
"Are you the man of God who came from Judah?"
"I am"
"Come home with me and eat bread"
"I may not return with you, or go in with you"
"I will not eat bread or drink water with you in this place"
"For it was said to me by the word of the Lord"
"'You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there'"
"'Nor return by the way that you came'"
"I also am a prophet as you are"
"And an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying"
"'Bring him back with you into your house'"
"'That he may eat bread and drink water'"
He lies to him
The man of God goes back with him
He eats bread in his house and drinks water
As they sit at the table
The word of the Lord comes to the prophet who has brought him back
He cries to the man of God who came from Judah
"Thus says the Lord"
"'Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord'"
"'And have not kept the command that the Lord your God commanded you'"
"'But have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water'"
"'In the place of which he said to you'"
"'"Eat no bread and drink no water"'"
"'Your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers'"
After he has eaten bread and drunk
He saddles the donkey for the prophet whom he has brought back
He goes away
A lion meets him on the road
The lion kills him
His body is thrown in the road
The donkey stands beside it
The lion also stands beside the body
Behold, men pass by and see the body thrown in the road
And the lion standing by the body
They come and tell it in the city where the old prophet dwells
When the prophet who brought him back from the way hears of it
"It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord"
"Therefore the Lord has given him to the lion"
"Which has torn him and killed him"
"According to the word that the Lord spoke to him"
He says to his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me"
They saddle it
He goes and finds his body thrown in the road
The donkey and the lion standing beside the body
The lion has not eaten the body or torn the donkey
The prophet takes up the body of the man of God
He lays it on the donkey
He brings it back to the city to mourn and to bury him
He lays the body in his own grave
They mourn over him, saying, "Alas, my brother"
After he has buried him, he says to his sons
"When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried"
"Lay my bones beside his bones"
"For the saying that he called out by the word of the Lord"
"Against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places"
"That are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass"
After this thing Jeroboam does not turn from his evil way
He again makes priests for the high places from among all the people
Any who will, he consecrates to be priests of the high places
This thing becomes sin to the house of Jeroboam
So as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth
At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam falls sick
Jeroboam says to his wife
"Arise, and disguise yourself"
"That it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam"
"And go to Shiloh"
"Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there"
"Who said of me that I should be king over this people"
"Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey"
"Go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child"
Jeroboam's wife does so
She arises and goes to Shiloh
She comes to the house of Ahijah
Ahijah cannot see, for his eyes are dim because of his age
The Lord says to Ahijah
"Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son"
"For he is sick"
"Thus and thus shall you say to her"
When she comes, she pretends to be another woman
When Ahijah hears the sound of her feet, as she comes in at the door
"Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another?"
"For I am charged with unbearable news for you"
"Go, tell Jeroboam, 'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel'"
"'I exalted you from among the people'"
"'I made you leader over my people Israel'"
"'I tore the kingdom away from the house of David'"
"'I gave it to you'"
"'Yet you have not been like my servant David'"
"'Who kept my commandments'"
"'And followed me with all his heart'"
"'Doing only that which was right in my eyes'"
"'But you have done evil above all who were before you'"
"'You have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images'"
"'Provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back'"
"'Therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam'"
"'I will cut off from Jeroboam every male'"
"'Both bond and free in Israel'"
"'I will burn up the house of Jeroboam'"
"'As a man burns up dung until it is all gone'"
"'Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city'"
"'The dogs shall eat'"
"'And anyone who dies in the open country'"
"'The birds of the heavens shall eat'"
"'For the Lord has spoken it'"
"'Arise therefore, go to your house'"
"'When your feet enter the city, the child shall die'"
"'All Israel shall mourn for him and bury him'"
"'For he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave'"
"'Because in him there is found something pleasing to the Lord'"
"'The God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam'"
"'Moreover, the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel'"
"'Who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today'"
"'And henceforth, the Lord will strike Israel'"
"'As a reed is shaken in the water'"
"'He will root up Israel out of this good land'"
"'That he gave to their fathers'"
"'He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates'"
"'Because they have made their Asherim'"
"'Provoking the Lord to anger'"
"'He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam'"
"'Which he sinned and made Israel to sin'"
Jeroboam's wife arises and departs
She comes to Tirzah
As she comes to the threshold of the house, the child dies
All Israel buries him and mourns for him
According to the word of the Lord
Which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet

To put his name there
His mother's name is Naamah the Ammonite
Judah does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
They provoke him to jealousy with their sins that they commit
More than all that their fathers have done
For they also build for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim
On every high hill and under every green tree
There are also male cult prostitutes in the land
They do according to all the abominations of the nations
That the Lord drives out before the people of Israel
In the fifth year of King Rehoboam
Shishak king of Egypt comes up against Jerusalem
He takes away the treasures of the house of the Lord
And the treasures of the king's house
He takes away everything
He also takes away all the shields of gold that Solomon has made
King Rehoboam makes in their place shields of bronze
He commits them to the hands of the officers of the guard
Who keep the door of the king's house
As often as the king goes into the house of the Lord
The guard carries them and brings them back to the guardroom

His heart is not wholly true to the Lord his God

Setting up his son after him
And establishing Jerusalem
Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord
And did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life

As David his father has done
He puts away the male cult prostitutes out of the land

He also removes Maacah his mother from being queen mother
Because she has made an abominable image for Asherah

The high places are not taken away
Nevertheless, the heart of Asa is wholly true to the Lord all his days
He brings into the house of the Lord the sacred gifts of his father
And his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels
There is war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days
Baasha king of Israel goes up against Judah
He builds Ramah, that he may permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah
Asa takes all the silver and the gold that are left in the treasures of the house of the Lord
And the treasures of the king's house
He gives them into the hands of his servants
King Asa sends them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon
The son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwells in Damascus
"Let there be a covenant between me and you"
"As there was between my father and your father"
"Behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold"
"Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel"
"That he may withdraw from me"
Ben-hadad listens to King Asa
He sends the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel
He conquers Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth
With all the land of Naphtali

He reigns in his place
As soon as he is king, he kills all the house of Jeroboam
He leaves to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathes
Until he has destroyed it
According to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite
It is for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned

"And made you leader over my people Israel"
"And you have walked in the way of Jeroboam"
"And have made my people Israel to sin"

"There shall be neither dew nor rain these years"
"Except by my word"
The word of the Lord comes to him
"Depart from here and turn eastward"
"Hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan"
"You shall drink from the brook"
"I have commanded the ravens to feed you there"
He goes and does according to the word of the Lord
He goes and dwells by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan
The ravens bring him bread and meat in the morning
And bread and meat in the evening
He drinks from the brook
After a while the brook dries up
Because there is no rain in the land
The word of the Lord comes to him
"Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there"
"Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you"
He arises and goes to Zarephath
When he comes to the gate of the city
Behold, a widow is there gathering sticks
He calls to her
"Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink"
As she is going to bring it
He calls to her, "Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand"
"As the Lord your God lives, I have nothing baked"
"Only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug"
"And now I am gathering a couple of sticks"
"That I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son"
"That we may eat it and die"
Elijah says to her, "Do not fear"
"Go and do as you have said"
"But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me"
"And afterward make something for yourself and your son"
"For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'The jar of flour shall not be spent'"
"'And the jug of oil shall not be empty'"
"'Until the day that the Lord sends rain upon the earth'"
She goes and does as Elijah says
She and he and her household eat for many days
The jar of flour is not spent
Neither does the jug of oil become empty
According to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah
After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, becomes ill
His illness is so severe that there is no breath left in him
She says to Elijah
"What have you against me, O man of God?"
"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance"
"And to cause the death of my son"
"Give me your son"
He takes him from her arms
He carries him up into the upper chamber where he lodges
He lays him on his own bed
He cries to the Lord
"O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow"
"With whom I sojourn, by killing her son?"
He stretches himself upon the child three times
He cries to the Lord
"O Lord my God, let this child's life come into him again"
The Lord listens to the voice of Elijah
The life of the child comes into him again, and he revives
Elijah takes the child and brings him down from the upper chamber into the house
He gives him to his mother
Elijah says, "See, your son lives"
The woman says to Elijah
"Now I know that you are a man of God"
"And that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth"
After many days the word of the Lord comes to Elijah, in the third year
"Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth"
Elijah goes to show himself to Ahab
Now the famine is severe in Samaria
Ahab calls Obadiah, who is over the household
(Now Obadiah fears the Lord greatly
When Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord
Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave
And fed them with bread and water)
Ahab says to Obadiah
"Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys"
"Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive"
"And not lose some of the animals"
They divide the land between them to pass through it
Ahab goes in one direction by himself
Obadiah goes in another direction by himself
As Obadiah is on the way, behold, Elijah meets him
Obadiah recognizes him
He falls on his face
"Is it you, my lord Elijah?"
"It is I. Go, tell your lord, 'Behold, Elijah is here'"
"How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab"
"To kill me?"
"As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom"
"Where my lord has not sent to seek you"
"And when they would say, 'He is not here,'"
"He would take an oath of the kingdom or nation"
"That they had not found you"
"And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here"'"
"As soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you"
"I know not where"
"And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you"
"He will kill me"
"Although I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth"
"Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets?"
"How I hid a hundred men of the Lord's prophets by fifties in a cave"
"And fed them with bread and water?"
"And now you say, 'Go, tell your lord, "Behold, Elijah is here"'"
"He will kill me"
Elijah says, "As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand"
"I will surely show myself to him today"
Obadiah goes to meet Ahab
He tells him
Ahab goes to meet Elijah
When Ahab sees Elijah, Ahab says to him
"Is it you, you troubler of Israel?"
"I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father's house"
"Because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord"
"And followed the Baals"
"Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel"
"And the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah"
"Who eat at Jezebel's table"
Ahab sends to all the people of Israel
He gathers the prophets together at Mount Carmel
Elijah comes near to all the people
"How long will you go limping between two different opinions?"
"If the Lord is God, follow him"
"But if Baal, then follow him"
The people do not answer him a word
Elijah says to the people
"I, even I only, am left a prophet of the Lord"
"But Baal's prophets are 450 men"
"Let two bulls be given to us"
"Let them choose one bull for themselves"
"Cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it"
"I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood"
"And put no fire to it"
"Then you call upon the name of your god"
"And I will call upon the name of the Lord"
"And the God who answers by fire, he is God"
All the people answer, "It is well spoken"
Elijah says to the prophets of Baal
"Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first"
"For you are many"
"And call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it"
They take the bull that is given them
They prepare it
They call upon the name of Baal from morning until noon
"O Baal, answer us"
There is no voice, and no one answers
They limp around the altar that they have made
At noon Elijah mocks them
"Cry aloud, for he is a god"
"Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself"
"Or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened"
They cry aloud
They cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances
Until the blood gushes out upon them
As midday passes, they rave on until the time of the offering of the oblation
There is no voice. No one answers; no one pays attention
Elijah says to all the people, "Come near to me"
All the people come near to him
He repairs the altar of the Lord that has been thrown down
Elijah takes twelve stones
According to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob
To whom the word of the Lord came, saying, "Israel shall be your name"
With the stones he builds an altar in the name of the Lord
He makes a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed
He puts the wood in order
He cuts the bull in pieces and lays it on the wood
"Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood"
"Do it a second time"
They do it a second time
"Do it a third time"
They do it a third time
The water runs around the altar
He fills the trench also with water
At the time of the offering of the oblation
Elijah the prophet comes near
"O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel"
"Let it be known this day that you are God in Israel"
"And that I am your servant"
"And that I have done all these things at your word"
"Answer me, O Lord, answer me"
"That this people may know that you, O Lord, are God"
"And that you have turned their hearts back"
The fire of the Lord falls
It consumes the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust
It licks up the water that is in the trench
When all the people see it, they fall on their faces
"The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God"
Elijah says to them, "Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape"
They seize them
Elijah brings them down to the brook Kishon
He slaughters them there
Elijah says to Ahab, "Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain"
Ahab goes up to eat and to drink
Elijah goes up to the top of Mount Carmel
He bows himself down on the earth
He puts his face between his knees
He says to his servant, "Go up now, look toward the sea"
He goes up and looks
"There is nothing"
He says, "Go again," seven times
At the seventh time he says, "Behold, a little cloud like a man's hand"
"Is rising from the sea"
"Go up, say to Ahab, 'Prepare your chariot and go down'"
"'Lest the rain stop you'"
In a little while the heavens grow black with clouds and wind
There is a great rain
Ahab rides and goes to Jezreel
The hand of the Lord is on Elijah
He gathered up his garment and runs before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel
Ahab tells Jezebel all that Elijah has done
How he has killed all the prophets with the sword
Jezebel sends a messenger to Elijah
"So may the gods do to me and more also"
"If I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow"
He is afraid
He arises and runs for his life
He comes to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah
He leaves his servant there
He himself goes a day's journey into the wilderness
He comes and sits down under a broom tree
He asks that he might die
"It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life"
"For I am no better than my fathers"
He lies down and sleeps under a broom tree
Behold, an angel touches him
"Arise and eat"
He looks, and behold, there is at his head a cake baked on hot stones
And a jar of water
He eats and drinks
He lies down again
The angel of the Lord comes a second time
He touches him
"Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you"
He arises and eats and drinks
He goes in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights
To Horeb, the mount of God
There he comes to a cave and lodges in it
Behold, the word of the Lord comes to him
"What are you doing here, Elijah?"
"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts"
"For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant"
"Thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword"
"I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away"
"Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord"
Behold, the Lord passes by
A great and strong wind tears the mountains
And breaks in pieces the rocks before the Lord
But the Lord is not in the wind
After the wind an earthquake
But the Lord is not in the earthquake
After the earthquake a fire
But the Lord is not in the fire
After the fire the sound of a low whisper
When Elijah hears it, he wraps his face in his cloak
He goes out and stands at the entrance of the cave
Behold, there comes a voice to him
"What are you doing here, Elijah?"
"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts"
"For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant"
"Thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword"
"I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away"
The Lord says to him
"Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus"
"When you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria"
"Also you shall anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi to be king over Israel"
"And Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet"
"In your place"
"And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death"
"And the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death"
"Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel"
"All the knees that have not bowed to Baal"
"And every mouth that has not kissed him"
He departs from there
He finds Elisha the son of Shaphat
Who is plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him
He is with the twelfth
Elijah passes by him and casts his cloak upon him
He leaves the oxen and runs after Elijah
"Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you"
"Go back again, for what have I done to you?"
He returns from following him
He takes the yoke of oxen and sacrifices them
He boils their flesh with the yokes of the oxen
He gives it to the people, and they eat
He arises and goes after Elijah
He assists him
Ben-hadad king of Syria gathers all his army
Thirty-two kings are with him, and horses and chariots
He goes up and besieges Samaria and fights against it
He sends messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel
"Thus says Ben-hadad: 'Your silver and your gold are mine'"
"'Your best wives and children also are mine'"
The king of Israel answers, "As you say, my lord, O king"
"I am yours, and all that I have"
The messengers come again
"Thus says Ben-hadad: 'I sent to you, saying'"
"'Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children'"
"'Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time'"
"'And they shall search your house and the houses of your servants'"
"'And lay hands on whatever pleases them and take it away'"
The king of Israel calls all the elders of the land
"Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble"
"For he sent to me for my wives and my children and for my silver and my gold"
"And I did not refuse him"
All the elders and all the people say to him
"Do not listen or consent"
So he says to the messengers of Ben-hadad
"Tell my lord the king, 'All that you first demanded of your servant I will do'"
"'But this thing I cannot do'"
The messengers depart and bring him word again
Ben-hadad sends to him
"The gods do so to me and more also"
"If the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me"
The king of Israel answers
"Tell him, 'Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off'"
When Ben-hadad hears this message as he is drinking
He and the kings in the booths
He says to his men, "Take your positions"
They take their positions against the city
Behold, a prophet comes near to Ahab king of Israel
"Thus says the Lord, 'Have you seen all this great multitude?'"
"'Behold, I will give it into your hand this day'"
"'And you shall know that I am the Lord'"
Ahab says, "By whom?"
"Thus says the Lord, 'By the servants of the governors of the districts'"
"Who shall begin the battle?"
"You"
He musters the servants of the governors of the districts
They are 232
After them he musters all the people of Israel, seven thousand
They go out at noon
Ben-hadad is drinking himself drunk in the booths
He and the thirty-two kings who help him
The servants of the governors of the districts go out first
Ben-hadad sends out scouts
They tell him, "Men are coming out from Samaria"
"If they have come out for peace, take them alive"
"If they have come out for war, take them alive"
These men of the governors of the districts go out of the city
The army that follows them
Each strikes down his man
The Syrians flee
Israel pursues them
Ben-hadad king of Syria escapes on a horse with horsemen
The king of Israel goes out and strikes the horses and chariots
He strikes the Syrians with a great blow
The prophet comes near to the king of Israel
"Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do"
"For in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you"
The servants of the king of Syria say to him
"Their gods are gods of the hills"
"That is why they were stronger than we"
"But let us fight against them in the plain"
"And surely we shall be stronger than they"
"Also do this: remove the kings, each from his post"
"And put commanders in their places"
"And muster an army like the army that you have lost"
"Horse for horse, and chariot for chariot"
"Then we will fight against them in the plain"
"And surely we shall be stronger than they"
He listens to their voice and does so
In the spring, Ben-hadad musters the Syrians
He goes up to Aphek to fight against Israel
The people of Israel are mustered and provisioned
They go against them
The people of Israel encamp before them like two little flocks of goats
But the Syrians fill the country
A man of God comes near
He says to the king of Israel
"Thus says the Lord, 'Because the Syrians have said'"
"'The Lord is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys'"
"'Therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand'"
"'And you shall know that I am the Lord'"
They encamp opposite one another seven days
On the seventh day the battle is joined
The people of Israel strike down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day
The rest flee into the city of Aphek
The wall falls upon 27,000 men who are left
Ben-hadad flees and enters an inner chamber in the city
His servants say to him
"Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings"
"Let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads"
"And go out to the king of Israel"
"Perhaps he will spare your life"
They tie sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads
They go to the king of Israel
"Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please, let me live'"
He says, "Does he still live? He is my brother"
The men are watching for a sign
They quickly take it up from him
"Yes, your brother Ben-hadad"
He says, "Go and bring him"
Ben-hadad comes out to him
He causes him to come up into the chariot
Ben-hadad says to him
"The cities that my father took from your father I will restore"
"And you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus"
"As my father did in Samaria"
Ahab says, "I will let you go on these terms"
He makes a covenant with him and lets him go
A certain man of the sons of the prophets says to his fellow
By the word of the Lord, "Strike me, please"
The man refuses to strike him
He says to him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord"
"Behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down"
As soon as he had departed from him, a lion meets him and strikes him down
He finds another man
"Strike me, please"
The man strikes him, striking and wounding him
The prophet departs and waits for the king by the way
He disguises himself with a bandage over his eyes
As the king passes, he cries to the king
"Your servant went out into the midst of the battle"
"And behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me"
"And said, 'Guard this man'"
"'If by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life'"
"'Or else you shall pay a talent of silver'"
"As your servant was busy here and there, he was gone"
The king of Israel says to him
"So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it"
He hurries to take the bandage away from his eyes
The king of Israel recognizes him as one of the prophets
He says to him, "Thus says the Lord"
"'Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction'"
"'Therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people'"
The king of Israel goes to his house vexed and sullen
He comes to Samaria
Now Naboth the Jezreelite has a vineyard in Jezreel
Beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria
Ahab speaks to Naboth
"Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden"
"Because it is near my house"
"I will give you a better vineyard for it"
"Or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money"
Naboth says to Ahab
"The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers"
Ahab goes into his house vexed and sullen
Because of what Naboth the Jezreelite has said to him
He lies down on his bed and turns away his face
He will eat no food
Jezebel his wife comes to him
"Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food?"
"Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite"
"And said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money'"
"'Or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it'"
"And he answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard'"
Jezebel his wife says to him
"Do you now govern Israel?"
"Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful"
"I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite"
She writes letters in Ahab's name
She seals them with his seal
She sends the letters to the elders and the leaders who live with Naboth in his city
She writes in the letters
"Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people"
"And set two worthless men opposite him"
"And let them bring a charge against him, saying"
"'You have cursed God and the king'"
"Then take him out and stone him to death"
The men of his city, the elders and the leaders who live in his city, do as Jezebel has sent word to them
As it is written in the letters that she has sent to them
They proclaim a fast
They set Naboth at the head of the people
The two worthless men come in
They sit opposite him
The worthless men bring a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people
"Naboth cursed God and the king"
They take him outside the city
They stone him to death with stones
They send to Jezebel, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead"
As soon as Jezebel hears that Naboth has been stoned and is dead
Jezebel says to Ahab
"Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite"
"Which he refused to give you for money"
"For Naboth is not alive, but dead"
As soon as Ahab hears that Naboth is dead
Ahab arises to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite
To take possession of it
The word of the Lord comes to Elijah the Tishbite
"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria"
"Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession"
"You shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord'"
"'Have you killed and also taken possession?'"
"And you shall say to him, 'Thus says the Lord'"
"'In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth'"
"'Shall dogs lick your own blood'"
Ahab says to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?"
"I have found you"
"Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord"
"'Behold, I will bring disaster upon you'"
"'I will utterly burn you up'"
"'And will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel'"
"'And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat'"
"'And like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah'"
"'For the anger to which you have provoked me'"
"'And because you have made Israel to sin'"
"And of Jezebel the Lord also has spoken, saying"
"'The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel'"
"'Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat'"
"'And anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat'"
There is none who sells himself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord like Ahab
Whom Jezebel his wife incites
He acts very abominably in going after idols
As the Amorites had done, whom the Lord cast out before the people of Israel
When Ahab hears those words, he tears his clothes
He puts sackcloth on his flesh and fasts
He lies in sackcloth and goes about dejectedly
The word of the Lord comes to Elijah the Tishbite
"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me?"
"Because he has humbled himself before me"
"I will not bring the disaster in his days"
"But in his son's days I will bring the disaster upon his house"
For three years Syria and Israel continue without war
In the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah comes down to the king of Israel
The king of Israel says to his servants
"Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us"
"And we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"
He says to Jehoshaphat
"Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?"
Jehoshaphat says to the king of Israel, "I am as you are"
"My people as your people, my horses as your horses"
Jehoshaphat says to the king of Israel
"Inquire first for the word of the Lord"
The king of Israel gathers the prophets together, about four hundred men
"Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain?"
They say, "Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king"
Jehoshaphat says, "Is there not here another prophet of the Lord"
"Of whom we may inquire?"
The king of Israel says to Jehoshaphat
"There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah the son of Imlah"
"But I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil"
Jehoshaphat says, "Let not the king say so"
The king of Israel calls an officer
"Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah"
Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah are sitting on their thrones
Arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria
All the prophets are prophesying before them
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah makes for himself horns of iron
"Thus says the Lord, 'With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed'"
All the prophets prophesy so
"Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king"
The messenger who goes to summon Micaiah says to him
"Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king"
"Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably"
Micaiah says, "As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that I will speak"
When he has come to the king
The king says to him, "Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain?"
He answers him, "Go up and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king"
The king says to him, "How many times shall I make you swear"
"That you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?"
"I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains"
"As sheep that have no shepherd"
"And the Lord said, 'These have no master'"
"'Let each return to his home in peace'"
The king of Israel says to Jehoshaphat
"Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"
Micaiah says, "Therefore hear the word of the Lord"
"I saw the Lord sitting on his throne"
"And all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left"
"And the Lord said, 'Who will entice Ahab'"
"'That he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?'"
"One said one thing, and another said another"
"Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying"
"'I will entice him'"
"'How?' the Lord asked him"
"'I will go out and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets'"
"He said, 'You are to entice him, and you shall succeed'"
"'Go out and do so'"
"Now therefore behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets"
"The Lord has declared disaster for you"
Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah comes near
He strikes Micaiah on the cheek
"How did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you?"
Micaiah says, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself"
The king of Israel says, "Seize Micaiah and take him back to Amon the governor of the city"
"And to Joash the king's son"
"And say, 'Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in prison'"
"'And feed him with meager rations of bread and water'"
"'Until I come in peace'"
Micaiah says, "If you return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me"
He says, "Hear, all you peoples"
The king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah go up to Ramoth-gilead
The king of Israel says to Jehoshaphat
"I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes"
The king of Israel disguises himself and goes into battle
Now the king of Syria has commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots
"Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel"
As soon as the captains of the chariots see Jehoshaphat
They say, "It is surely the king of Israel"
They turn to fight against him
Jehoshaphat cries out
When the captains of the chariots see that it is not the king of Israel
They turn back from pursuing him
A certain man draws his bow at random
He strikes the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate
He says to the driver of his chariot, "Turn around and carry me out of the battle"
"For I am wounded"
The battle grows hot that day
The king is propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians
He dies at evening
The blood of the wound flows into the bottom of the chariot
About sunset a cry goes through the army
"Every man to his city, and every man to his country"
The king dies and is brought to Samaria
They bury the king in Samaria
They wash the chariot by the pool of Samaria
The dogs lick up his blood
The prostitutes wash themselves in it
According to the word of the Lord that he had spoken
Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did
And the ivory house that he built
And all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
Ahab sleeps with his fathers
Ahaziah his son reigns in his place
Jehoshaphat the son of Asa begins to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel
Jehoshaphat is thirty-five years old when he begins to reign
He reigns twenty-five years in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Azubah the daughter of Shilhi
He walks in all the way of Asa his father
He does not turn aside from it, doing what is right in the sight of the Lord
Yet the high places are not taken away
The people still sacrifice and make offerings on the high places
Jehoshaphat also makes peace with the king of Israel
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat and his might that he showed
And how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
The remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remain in the days of his father Asa
He exterminated from the land
There is no king in Edom; a deputy is king
Jehoshaphat makes ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold
But they do not go, for the ships are wrecked at Ezion-geber
Ahaziah the son of Ahab says to Jehoshaphat
"Let my servants go with your servants in the ships"
Jehoshaphat is not willing
Jehoshaphat sleeps with his fathers
He is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father
Jehoram his son reigns in his place
Ahaziah the son of Ahab begins to reign over Israel in Samaria
In the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah
He reigns two years over Israel
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
He walks in the way of his father and in the way of his mother
And in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin
He serves Baal and worships him
He provokes the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done
Ahaziah falls through the lattice in his upper chamber in Samaria
He lies injured
He sends messengers, telling them
"Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this injury"
The angel of the Lord says to Elijah the Tishbite
"Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria"
"And say to them, 'Is it because there is no God in Israel'"
"'That you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?'"
"Now therefore thus says the Lord"
"'You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up'"
"'But you shall surely die'"
So Elijah goes
The messengers return to the king
He says to them, "Why have you returned?"
They say to him, "There came a man to meet us"
"And he said to us, 'Go back to the king who sent you'"
"'And say to him, "Thus says the Lord"'"
"'"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?"'"
"'"Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up, but you shall surely die"'"
He says to them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"
They answer him, "He wore a garment of hair, with a belt of leather about his waist"
He says, "It is Elijah the Tishbite"
The king sends to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty
He goes up to Elijah, who is sitting on the top of a hill
He says to him, "O man of God, the king says, 'Come down'"
Elijah answers the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God"
"Let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty"
Fire comes down from heaven and consumes him and his fifty
Again the king sends to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty
He goes up and says to him, "O man of God, this is the king's order, 'Come down quickly'"
Elijah answers them, "If I am a man of God"
"Let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty"
The fire of God comes down from heaven and consumes him and his fifty
Again the king sends the captain of a third fifty with his fifty
The third captain of fifty goes up and comes and falls on his knees before Elijah
He entreats him, "O man of God, please let my life and the life of these fifty servants of yours be precious in your sight"
"Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties"
"But now let my life be precious in your sight"
The angel of the Lord says to Elijah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him"
He arises and goes down with him to the king
He says to him, "Thus says the Lord"
"'Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron'"
"'Is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?'"
"'Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone up'"
"'But you shall surely die'"
He dies according to the word of the Lord that Elijah has spoken
Jehoram becomes king in his place in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah
Because Ahaziah has no son
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
Now when the Lord is about to take Elijah up to heaven by a whirlwind
Elijah and Elisha are on their way from Gilgal
Elijah says to Elisha, "Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me as far as Bethel"
Elisha says, "As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you"
They go down to Bethel
The sons of the prophets who are in Bethel come out to Elisha
"Do you know that today the Lord will take away your master from over you?"
He says, "Yes, I know it; keep quiet"
Elijah says to him, "Elisha, please stay here, for the Lord has sent me to Jericho"
"As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you"
They come to Jericho
The sons of the prophets who are at Jericho draw near to Elisha
"Do you know that today the Lord will take away your master from over you?"
He answers, "Yes, I know it; keep quiet"
Elijah says to him, "Please stay here, for the Lord has sent me to the Jordan"
"As the Lord lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you"
The two of them go on
Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also go and stand at some distance from them
As they both are standing by the Jordan
Elijah takes his cloak and rolls it up
He strikes the water
The water is parted to the one side and to the other
Till the two of them cross on dry ground
When they have crossed, Elijah says to Elisha
"Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you"
Elisha says, "Please let there be a double portion of your spirit on me"
"You have asked a hard thing"
"Yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you"
"But if you do not see me, it shall not be so"
As they still go on and talk
Behold, chariots of fire and horses of fire separate the two of them
Elijah goes up by a whirlwind into heaven
Elisha sees it and cries out, "My father, my father!"
"The chariots of Israel and its horsemen!"
He sees him no more
He takes hold of his own clothes and tears them in two pieces
He takes up the cloak of Elijah that has fallen from him
He goes back and stands on the bank of the Jordan
He takes the cloak of Elijah that has fallen from him
He strikes the water, saying, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?"
When he has struck the water
The water is parted to the one side and to the other
Elisha goes over
Now when the sons of the prophets who are at Jericho see him opposite them
They say, "The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha"
They come to meet him and bow to the ground before him
They say to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men"
"Please let them go and seek your master"
"It may be that the Spirit of the Lord has caught him up"
"And cast him upon some mountain or into some valley"
He says, "You shall not send"
When they urge him till he is ashamed, he says, "Send"
They send therefore fifty men
For three days they seek him but do not find him
They come back to him while he is staying at Jericho
He says to them, "Did I not say to you, 'Do not go'?"
Men of Jericho complain to Elisha that the water is bad and the land unfruitful
Elisha heals the spring with salt in a new bowl
Elisha goes up to Bethel
Young boys mock him: "Go up, you baldhead"
Elisha curses them in the name of the Lord
Two she-bears come out of the woods and tear forty-two of the boys
Elisha goes to Mount Carmel, then returns to Samaria
Jehoram son of Ahab becomes king over Israel
He does evil in the Lord's sight but removes the pillar of Baal his father had made
Mesha king of Moab rebels against Israel after Ahab's death
Jehoram musters all Israel and sends to Jehoshaphat king of Judah for alliance
Israel, Judah, and Edom march seven days through wilderness without water
Jehoram despairs, but Jehoshaphat asks for a prophet of the Lord
They go to Elisha
Elisha rebukes Jehoram but respects Jehoshaphat
Elisha calls for a musician
The hand of the Lord comes upon Elisha as the musician plays
Elisha prophesies water without wind or rain, and victory over Moab
Water flows from the direction of Edom, filling the valley
Moabites see the water red as blood and think the kings have slain each other
Moabites come to plunder but Israel rises and strikes them
Israel pursues Moabites into their land, destroying cities
King of Moab offers his firstborn son as burnt offering on the wall
Great wrath comes upon Israel; they withdraw to their own land
A widow of a prophet cries to Elisha: her creditor will take her two children as slaves
Elisha asks what she has; she has only a jar of oil
Elisha tells her to borrow many vessels and pour oil
The oil multiplies until all vessels are filled
She sells the oil, pays her debt, and lives on the rest
Elisha passes through Shunem regularly
A wealthy Shunammite woman urges him to eat with her
She persuades her husband to build Elisha a small upper room
Elisha wishes to repay her kindness
Gehazi notes she has no son and her husband is old
Elisha promises she will embrace a son
She protests, "Do not lie to your servant"
The woman conceives and bears a son in due season
When the child is grown, he goes to his father among the reapers
The child cries out, "My head, my head!"
A servant carries him to his mother
The child sits on her lap until noon, then dies
She lays him on Elisha's bed and shuts the door
She calls her husband to send her a servant and a donkey to go to Elisha
Her husband questions why she goes today
She says, "All is well," and goes to Mount Carmel
Elisha sees her coming and sends Gehazi to meet her
She says all is well but goes straight to Elisha and grasps his feet
"Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, 'Do not deceive me'?"
Elisha sends Gehazi ahead with his staff to lay on the child's face
The woman refuses to leave without Elisha
Gehazi goes ahead and lays the staff on the child, but no sound or sign of life
Gehazi returns: "The child has not awakened"
Elisha enters the house and finds the child dead on his bed
Elisha prays to the Lord
He lies upon the child, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands
The child's flesh grows warm
Elisha walks back and forth, then stretches himself upon him again
The child sneezes seven times and opens his eyes
Elisha calls Gehazi to summon the Shunammite
She comes, falls at his feet, bows to the ground, and takes up her son
Elisha returns to Gilgal during a famine
Sons of the prophets are sitting before him
Elisha tells his servant to set on the large pot and make stew
One goes to the field to gather herbs and finds wild gourds
He shreds them into the pot of stew, not knowing what they are
They pour out for the men to eat
As they eat, they cry out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!"
Elisha calls for flour and throws it into the pot
There is no harm in the pot
A man comes from Baal-shalishah bringing bread of firstfruits and fresh grain
Elisha says to give it to the men to eat
His servant protests: "How can I set this before a hundred men?"
Elisha repeats the command, adding that the Lord says they will eat and have some left
They eat and have some left over, according to the Lord's word
Naaman, commander of the Syrian army, is a great and mighty man of valor
But he is a leper
Syrian raiders have carried away a young Israelite girl who serves Naaman's wife
She says to her mistress, "Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria!"
"He would cure him of his leprosy"
Naaman tells his king what the girl said
The king of Syria sends Naaman with a letter to the king of Israel
Naaman goes, taking silver, gold, and garments
The letter says, "I have sent Naaman my servant to you, that you may cure him of his leprosy"
The king of Israel tears his clothes in distress
"Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to cure a man of his leprosy?"
Elisha hears the king has torn his clothes
He sends word: "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me"
Naaman comes with his horses and chariots and stands at Elisha's door
Elisha sends a messenger: "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times"
"Your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean"
Naaman is angry and goes away
"I thought he would surely come out and stand and call upon the name of the Lord his God"
"Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?"
His servants approach him
"My father, it is a great word the prophet has spoken to you; will you not do it?"
"Has he actually said to you, 'Wash, and be clean'?"
Naaman goes down and dips himself seven times in the Jordan
His flesh is restored like the flesh of a little child
He is clean
Naaman returns to Elisha with all his company
He stands before him and declares, "Now I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel"
"Please accept a present from your servant"
Elisha refuses: "As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will receive none"
Naaman urges him, but he refuses
Naaman asks for two mule-loads of earth
"For from now on your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the Lord"
He asks pardon: when his master leans on his arm in the house of Rimmon and bows
"When I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, may the Lord pardon your servant"
Elisha says, "Go in peace"
Naaman departs
Gehazi, Elisha's servant, thinks, "My master has spared this Naaman, in not accepting what he brought"
"As the Lord lives, I will run after him and get something from him"
Gehazi pursues Naaman
Naaman sees someone running after him and alights from the chariot
"Is all well?"
Gehazi says all is well, but Elisha has sent him
"Two young men of the sons of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of Ephraim"
"Please give them a talent of silver and two changes of clothing"
Naaman urges him to accept two talents
He binds two talents in two bags with two changes of clothing
He lays them on two of his servants who carry them before Gehazi
When Gehazi comes to the hill, he takes them and hides them in the house
He dismisses the men
Gehazi enters and stands before Elisha
"Where have you been, Gehazi?"
"Your servant went nowhere"
"Did not my heart go when the man turned from his chariot to meet you?"
"Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants?"
"Therefore the leprosy of Naaman shall cling to you and to your descendants forever"
Gehazi goes out from his presence a leper, as white as snow
The sons of the prophets say to Elisha, "The place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us"
"Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there"
Elisha agrees, and at their urging, goes with them
They come to the Jordan and cut down trees
As one is felling a log, his axe head falls into the water
He cries out, "Alas, my master! It was borrowed"
Elisha asks where it fell, and the man shows him the place
Elisha cuts off a stick and throws it there
The iron floats
"Take it up"
He reaches out his hand and takes it
The king of Syria is warring against Israel
He takes counsel with his servants about where to encamp
Elisha warns the king of Israel: "Beware that you do not pass this place"
"For the Syrians are going down there"
The king of Israel sends to the place Elisha told him
Elisha saves him there more than once or twice
The mind of the king of Syria is greatly troubled
He calls his servants and demands to know who is betraying him to Israel
One of his servants tells him, "Elisha the prophet tells the king of Israel the words you speak in your bedroom"
The king commands, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him"
Word comes that Elisha is in Dothan
The king sends horses and chariots and a great army by night
They surround the city
Elisha's servant rises early and goes out
He sees the army with horses and chariots all around the city
"Alas, my master! What shall we do?"
"Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them"
Elisha prays, "O Lord, please open his eyes that he may see"
The Lord opens the young man's eyes
He sees the mountain full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha
The Syrians come down against Elisha
Elisha prays, "Please strike this people with blindness"
The Lord strikes them with blindness
Elisha tells them, "This is not the way, and this is not the city"
"Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek"
He leads them to Samaria
When they enter Samaria, Elisha prays, "O Lord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see"
The Lord opens their eyes
They see they are in the midst of Samaria
The king of Israel sees them and asks Elisha, "My father, shall I strike them down?"
"You shall not strike them down"
"Would you strike down those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow?"
"Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master"
He prepares a great feast for them
When they have eaten and drunk, he sends them away to their master
The Syrians do not come again on raids into the land of Israel
Afterward Ben-hadad king of Syria musters his entire army
He goes up and besieges Samaria
There is a great famine in Samaria as they besiege it
A donkey's head is sold for eighty shekels of silver
A fourth of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver
As the king of Israel is passing by on the wall
A woman cries to him, "Help, my lord, O king!"
"If the Lord will not help you, how shall I help you?"
"From the threshing floor, or from the winepress?"
"What is your trouble?"
"This woman said to me, 'Give your son, that we may eat him today'"
"'And we will eat my son tomorrow'"
"So we boiled my son and ate him"
"And on the next day I said to her, 'Give your son, that we may eat him'"
"But she has hidden her son"
When the king hears the woman's words, he tears his clothes
As he passes by on the wall, the people see he is wearing sackcloth beneath
"May God do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today"
Elisha is sitting in his house, and the elders are sitting with him
The king sends a man ahead
Before the messenger arrives, Elisha says to the elders
"Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head?"
"Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door and hold the door fast against him"
"Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"
While Elisha is still speaking with them, the messenger comes down to him
The king says, "This trouble is from the Lord!"
"Why should I wait for the Lord any longer?"
Elisha says, "Hear the word of the Lord"
"Thus says the Lord, 'Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel'"
"'And two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria'"
The captain on whose hand the king leans answers Elisha
"If the Lord himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?"
"You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it"
Four men who are lepers are at the entrance to the gate
They say to one another, "Why are we sitting here until we die?"
"If we say, 'Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there"
"If we sit here, we die also"
"So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians"
"If they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die"
They arise at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians
When they come to the edge of the camp, no one is there
The Lord has made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots and horses
The sound of a great army
They say to one another, "The king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come against us"
They flee in the twilight, abandoning tents, horses, donkeys, and the camp as it is
They flee for their lives
The lepers come to the edge of the camp
They enter a tent, eat and drink
They carry off silver, gold, and clothing and hide them
They return and enter another tent and carry off things from it and hide them
They say to one another, "We are not doing right"
"This day is a day of good news"
"If we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us"
"Now therefore come; let us go and tell the king's household"
They come and call to the gatekeepers of the city
They tell them, "We came to the camp of the Syrians"
"And behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there"
"Nothing but the horses tied and the donkeys tied and the tents as they were"
The gatekeepers call out and tell it within the king's household
The king rises in the night
He says to his servants, "I will tell you what the Syrians have done to us"
"They know that we are hungry"
"Therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the open country"
"Thinking, 'When they come out of the city, we shall take them alive'"
"'And get into the city'"
One of his servants answers
"Let some men take five of the remaining horses"
"Seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel who have already perished"
"Let us send and see"
They take two horsemen
The king sends them after the army of the Syrians, saying, "Go and see"
They go after them as far as the Jordan
All the way is littered with garments and equipment the Syrians have thrown away in their haste
The messengers return and tell the king
The people go out and plunder the camp of the Syrians
A seah of fine flour is sold for a shekel
Two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord
The king appoints the captain on whose hand he leans to have charge of the gate
The people trample him in the gate
He dies, as Elisha had said when the king came down to him
It happens as Elisha told him: "Two seahs of barley for a shekel, and a seah of fine flour for a shekel"
"Shall be at the gate of Samaria tomorrow about this time"
The captain had answered, "If the Lord himself should make windows in heaven, could such a thing be?"
Elisha had said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it"
It happens to him, for the people trample him in the gate and he dies
Elisha has said to the woman whose son he restored to life
"Arise, and depart with your household, and sojourn wherever you can"
"For the Lord has called for a famine, and it will come upon the land for seven years"
The woman arises and does according to Elisha's word
She and her household sojourn in the land of the Philistines seven years
At the end of seven years, the woman returns from the land of the Philistines
She goes to appeal to the king for her house and her land
The king is talking with Gehazi the servant of Elisha
"Tell me all the great things that Elisha has done"
While Gehazi is telling the king how Elisha restored the dead to life
The woman whose son Elisha restored to life appeals to the king
Gehazi says, "My lord, O king, here is the woman, and here is her son whom Elisha restored to life"
The king questions the woman, and she tells him
The king appoints an official for her
"Restore all that was hers, together with all the produce of the fields from the day that she left the land until now"
Elisha comes to Damascus
Ben-hadad the king of Syria is sick
It is told him, "The man of God has come here"
The king says to Hazael, "Take a present with you and go to meet the man of God"
"And inquire of the Lord through him, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'"
Hazael goes to meet Elisha
He takes a present with him, all kinds of goods of Damascus, forty camel loads
He comes and stands before him
"Your son Ben-hadad king of Syria has sent me to you, saying, 'Shall I recover from this sickness?'"
Elisha says to him, "Go, say to him, 'You shall certainly recover'"
"But the Lord has shown me that he shall certainly die"
Elisha fixes his gaze and stares at Hazael until he is ashamed
The man of God weeps
Hazael asks, "Why does my lord weep?"
"Because I know the evil that you will do to the people of Israel"
"You will set on fire their fortresses"
"You will kill their young men with the sword"
"Dash in pieces their little ones"
"And rip open their pregnant women"
Hazael says, "What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?"
"The Lord has shown me that you are to be king over Syria"
Hazael departs from Elisha and comes to his master
Ben-hadad asks him, "What did Elisha say to you?"
"He told me that you would certainly recover"
On the following day Hazael takes the bed cloth and dips it in water
He spreads it over Ben-hadad's face
Ben-hadad dies
Hazael becomes king in his place
In the fifth year of Joram son of Ahab king of Israel
Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah begins to reign
He is thirty-two years old when he becomes king
He reigns eight years in Jerusalem
He walks in the way of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done
For the daughter of Ahab is his wife
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
Yet the Lord is not willing to destroy Judah, for the sake of David his servant
Since he promised to give a lamp to him and to his sons forever
In his days Edom revolts from the rule of Judah
They set up a king of their own
Jehoram passes over to Zair with all his chariots
He rises by night and strikes the Edomites who have surrounded him
And the captains of the chariots
His army flees home
So Edom revolts from the rule of Judah to this day
Libnah also revolts at the same time
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoram and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
Jehoram sleeps with his fathers
He is buried with his fathers in the city of David
Ahaziah his son reigns in his place
In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab, king of Israel
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah, begins to reign
Ahaziah is twenty-two years old when he begins to reign
He reigns one year in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Athaliah; she is a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel
He walks in the way of the house of Ahab
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord, as the house of Ahab had done
For he is son-in-law to the house of Ahab
He goes with Joram the son of Ahab to wage war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead
The Syrians wound Joram
King Joram returns to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians have given him at Ramah
When he fights against Hazael king of Syria
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah goes down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel
Because he is wounded
Elisha the prophet calls one of the sons of the prophets
"Tie up your garments, and take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead"
"When you arrive, look there for Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi"
"Go in and have him rise from among his fellows, and lead him to an inner chamber"
"Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say"
"'Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel'"
"Then open the door and flee; do not linger"
The young man, the servant of the prophet, goes to Ramoth-gilead
When he comes, the commanders of the army are in council
He says, "I have a word for you, O commander"
Jehu asks, "To which of us all?"
"To you, O commander"
Jehu rises and goes into the house
The young man pours the oil on his head
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, I anoint you king over the people of the Lord, over Israel"
"You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master"
"So that I may avenge on Jezebel the blood of my servants the prophets"
"And the blood of all the servants of the Lord"
"For the whole house of Ahab shall perish"
"I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel"
"I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat"
"And like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah"
"The dogs shall eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel, and none shall bury her"
Then he opens the door and flees
Jehu comes out to the servants of his master
They say to him, "Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you?"
"You know the fellow and his talk"
"That is not true; tell us now"
"Thus and so he spoke to me, saying, 'Thus says the Lord, I anoint you king over Israel'"
Then they hurry and each takes his garment and puts it under him on the bare steps
They blow the trumpet and proclaim, "Jehu is king"
Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspires against Joram
Now Joram with all Israel has been on guard at Ramoth-gilead against Hazael king of Syria
But King Joram has returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds that the Syrians have given him
When he fights with Hazael king of Syria
Jehu says, "If this is your decision, then let no one slip out of the city to go and tell the news in Jezreel"
Jehu mounts his chariot and goes to Jezreel
For Joram is lying there
Ahaziah king of Judah has come down to visit Joram
The watchman standing on the tower in Jezreel spies the company of Jehu as he comes
"I see a company"
Joram says, "Take a horseman and send to meet them, and let him say, 'Is it peace?'"
A man on horseback goes to meet him
"Thus says the king, 'Is it peace?'"
"What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me"
The watchman reports, "The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back"
He sends out a second horseman
He comes to them and says, "Thus the king has said, 'Is it peace?'"
"What do you have to do with peace? Turn around and ride behind me"
The watchman reports, "He reached them, but he is not coming back"
"And the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously"
Joram says, "Make ready"
They make ready his chariot
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah set out
Each in his chariot
They set out to meet Jehu
They meet him at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite
When Joram sees Jehu, he says, "Is it peace, Jehu?"
"What peace can there be, so long as the whorings and the sorceries of your mother Jezebel are so many?"
Joram reins about and flees
He says to Ahaziah, "Treachery, O Ahaziah!"
Jehu draws his bow with his full strength
He shoots Joram between the shoulders
The arrow pierces his heart
Jehu sinks in his chariot
Jehu says to Bidkar his aide, "Take him up and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite"
"For remember, when you and I rode side by side behind Ahab his father"
"How the Lord made this pronouncement against him"
"'As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, declares the Lord'"
"'I will repay you on this plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the Lord'"
They take him up and throw him on the plot of ground, in accordance with the word of the Lord
When Ahaziah the king of Judah sees this, he flees in the direction of Beth-haggan
Jehu pursues him
"Shoot him also"
They shoot him in the chariot at the ascent of Gur, which is by Ibleam
He flees to Megiddo and dies there
His servants carry him in a chariot to Jerusalem
They bury him in his tomb with his fathers in the city of David
In the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab, Ahaziah begins to reign over Judah
When Jehu comes to Jezreel, Jezebel hears of it
She paints her eyes and adorns her head
She looks out of the window
As Jehu enters the gate, she says, "Is it peace, you Zimri, murderer of your master?"
Jehu looks up to the window
"Who is on my side? Who?"
Two or three eunuchs look out at him
"Throw her down"
They throw her down
Some of her blood spatters on the wall and on the horses
They trample on her
Jehu goes in and eats and drinks
"See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter"
They go to bury her
They find no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands
They come back and tell him
"This is the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite"
"'In the territory of Jezreel the dogs shall eat the flesh of Jezebel'"
"'And the corpse of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the territory of Jezreel'"
"'So that no one can say, This is Jezebel'"
Ahab has seventy sons in Samaria
Jehu writes letters and sends them to Samaria
To the rulers of the city, to the elders, and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab
"Now then, as soon as this letter reaches you, seeing your master's sons are with you"
"And there are with you chariots and horses, fortified cities, and weapons"
"Select the best and fittest of your master's sons and set him on his father's throne and fight for your master's house"
They are exceedingly afraid
"Behold, the two kings could not stand before him. How then can we stand?"
The steward of the palace, and he who is over the city, together with the elders and the guardians, send to Jehu
"We are your servants, and we will do all that you tell us"
"We will not make anyone king. Do whatever is good in your eyes"
He writes to them a second letter
"If you are on my side, and if you are ready to obey me, take the heads of your master's sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow at this time"
Now the king's sons, seventy persons, are with the great men of the city, who are bringing them up
When the letter comes to them, they take the king's sons and slaughter them, seventy persons
They put their heads in baskets and send them to him at Jezreel
When the messenger comes and tells him, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons"
He says, "Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning"
In the morning, when he goes out, he stands and says to all the people
"You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him"
"But who struck down all these?"
"Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the Lord"
"Which the Lord spoke concerning the house of Ahab"
"For the Lord has done what he said by his servant Elijah"
Jehu strikes down all who remain of the house of Ahab in Jezreel
All his great men and his close friends and his priests
Until he leaves him none remaining
He sets out and goes to Samaria
On the way, when he is at Beth-eked of the Shepherds
Jehu meets the relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah
"Who are you?"
"We are the relatives of Ahaziah, and we came down to visit the royal princes and the sons of the queen mother"
"Take them alive"
They take them alive and slaughter them at the pit of Beth-eked, forty-two persons
He spares none of them
When he departs from there, he meets Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him
He greets him and says to him, "Is your heart true to my heart as mine is to yours?"
Jehonadab answers, "It is"
Jehu says, "If it is, give me your hand"
Jehonadab gives him his hand
Jehu takes him up with him into the chariot
"Come with me, and see my zeal for the Lord"
They have him ride in his chariot
When he comes to Samaria, he strikes down all who remain to Ahab in Samaria
Till he has wiped them out, according to the word of the Lord that he spoke to Elijah
Jehu assembles all the people
"Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him much"
"Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his worshipers and all his priests"
"Let none be missing, for I have a great sacrifice to offer to Baal"
"Whoever is missing shall not live"
Jehu does it with cunning in order to destroy the worshipers of Baal
Jehu orders, "Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal"
They proclaim it
Jehu sends throughout all Israel
All the worshipers of Baal come, so that there is not a man left who does not come
They enter the house of Baal
The house of Baal is filled from one end to the other
He says to him who is in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out the vestments for all the worshipers of Baal"
He brings out the vestments for them
Jehu goes into the house of Baal with Jehonadab the son of Rechab
He says to the worshipers of Baal, "Search, and see that there is no servant of the Lord here among you"
"But only the worshipers of Baal"
They go in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings
Jehu has stationed eighty men outside
"The man who allows any of those whom I give into your hands to escape shall forfeit his life"
As soon as he has made an end of offering the burnt offering
Jehu says to the guard and to the officers, "Go in and strike them down; let not a man escape"
They strike them down with the edge of the sword
The guard and the officers cast them out
They go into the inner room of the house of Baal
They bring out the pillar that is in the house of Baal and burn it
They demolish the pillar of Baal
They demolish the house of Baal
They make it a latrine to this day
Thus Jehu wipes out Baal from Israel
But Jehu does not turn aside from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat
Which he makes Israel to sin
The golden calves that are in Bethel and in Dan
The Lord says to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what is right in my eyes"
"And have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart"
"Your sons of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel"
But Jehu is not careful to walk in the law of the Lord, the God of Israel, with all his heart
He does not turn from the sins of Jeroboam, which he makes Israel to sin
In those days the Lord begins to cut off parts of Israel
Hazael defeats them throughout the territory of Israel
From the Jordan eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites
From Aroer, which is by the Valley of the Arnon, that is, Gilead and Bashan
Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
Jehu sleeps with his fathers
They bury him in Samaria
Jehoahaz his son reigns in his place
The time that Jehu reigns over Israel in Samaria is twenty-eight years
When Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah sees that her son is dead
She arises and destroys all the royal family
But Jehosheba, the daughter of King Joram, sister of Ahaziah, takes Joash the son of Ahaziah
She steals him away from among the king's sons who are being put to death
She puts him and his nurse in a bedroom
Thus they hide him from Athaliah, so that he is not put to death
He remains with her six years, hidden in the house of the Lord
While Athaliah reigns over the land
In the seventh year Jehoiada sends and brings the captains of the Carites and of the guards
He has them come to him in the house of the Lord
He makes a covenant with them and puts them under oath in the house of the Lord
He shows them the king's son
He commands them, "This is the thing that you shall do"
"One third of you, those who come off duty on the Sabbath and guard the king's house"
"Another third being at the gate Sur and a third at the gate behind the guards"
"Shall guard the palace"
"And the two divisions of you, which come on duty in force on the Sabbath and guard the house of the Lord on behalf of the king"
"Shall surround the king, each with his weapons in his hand"
"And whoever approaches the ranks is to be put to death"
"Be with the king when he goes out and when he comes in"
The captains do according to all that Jehoiada the priest commands
Each brings his men who are to go off duty on the Sabbath, with those who are to come on duty on the Sabbath
They come to Jehoiada the priest
The priest gives to the captains the spears and shields that have been King David's
Which are in the house of the Lord
The guards stand, every man with his weapons in his hand
From the south side of the house to the north side of the house, around the altar and the house on behalf of the king
He brings out the king's son and puts the crown on him and gives him the testimony
They proclaim him king and anoint him
They clap their hands and say, "Long live the king!"
When Athaliah hears the noise of the guard and of the people
She goes into the house of the Lord to the people
She looks, and there is the king standing by the pillar, according to the custom
With the captains and the trumpeters beside the king
All the people of the land rejoicing and blowing trumpets
Athaliah tears her clothes and cries, "Treason! Treason!"
Jehoiada the priest commands the captains who are set over the army
"Bring her out between the ranks, and put to death with the sword anyone who follows her"
For the priest says, "Let her not be put to death in the house of the Lord"
They lay hands on her
She goes through the horses' entrance to the king's house
She is put to death there
Jehoiada makes a covenant between the Lord and the king and people
That they should be the Lord's people
Also between the king and the people
All the people of the land go to the house of Baal and tear it down
His altars and his images they break in pieces
They kill Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars
The priest posts watchmen over the house of the Lord
He takes the captains, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land
They bring the king down from the house of the Lord
Marching through the gate of the guards to the king's house
He takes his seat on the throne of the kings
All the people of the land rejoice
The city is quiet after Athaliah has been put to death with the sword at the king's house
Jehoash is seven years old when he begins to reign
In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash begins to reign
He reigns forty years in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Zibiah of Beersheba
Jehoash does what is right in the eyes of the Lord all his days
Because Jehoiada the priest instructs him
Nevertheless, the high places are not taken away
The people continue to sacrifice and make offerings on the high places
Jehoash says to the priests, "All the money of the holy things that is brought into the house of the Lord"
"The money for which each man is assessed, the money from the assessment of persons"
"And the money that a man's heart prompts him to bring into the house of the Lord"
"Let the priests take, each from his donor, and let them repair the house wherever any need of repairs is discovered"
By the twenty-third year of King Jehoash, the priests have made no repairs on the house
King Jehoash summons Jehoiada the priest and the other priests
"Why are you not repairing the house? Now therefore take no more money from your donors"
"But hand it over for the repair of the house"
The priests agree that they should take no more money from the people
And that they should not repair the house
Jehoiada the priest takes a chest and bores a hole in the lid
He sets it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the house of the Lord
The priests who guard the threshold put in it all the money that is brought into the house of the Lord
Whenever they see that there is much money in the chest
The king's secretary and the high priest come up and they count and tie up in bags the money that is found in the house of the Lord
They give the money that is weighed out into the hands of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord
They pay it out to the carpenters and the builders who work on the house of the Lord
And to the masons and the stonecutters
As well as to buy timber and quarried stone for making repairs on the house of the Lord
And for any outlay for the repairs of the house
But there are not made for the house of the Lord basins of silver, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels of gold, or of silver
From the money that is brought into the house of the Lord
For that is given to the workmen who are repairing the house of the Lord with it
They do not ask for an accounting from the men into whose hand they deliver the money to pay out to the workmen
For they deal honestly
The money from the guilt offerings and the money from the sin offerings is not brought into the house of the Lord
It belongs to the priests
At that time Hazael king of Syria goes up and fights against Gath and takes it
Hazael sets his face to go up against Jerusalem
Jehoash king of Judah takes all the sacred gifts that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah his fathers, the kings of Judah, have dedicated
And his own sacred gifts, and all the gold that is found in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house
He sends these to Hazael king of Syria
Hazael withdraws from Jerusalem
Now the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

He does not depart from them
The anger of the Lord is kindled against Israel
He gives them continually into the hand of Hazael king of Syria
And into the hand of Ben-hadad the son of Hazael
Jehoahaz entreats the favor of the Lord
The Lord listens to him
For he sees the oppression of Israel, how the king of Syria oppresses them
Therefore the Lord gives Israel a savior, so that they escape from the hand of the Syrians
The people of Israel dwell in their homes as formerly
Nevertheless, they do not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, which he makes Israel to sin
They walk in them
The Asherah also remains in Samaria
For there is not left to Jehoahaz an army of more than fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen
For the king of Syria has destroyed them and made them like the dust at threshing
Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?

Then he says to the king of Israel, "Draw the bow"
He draws it
Elisha lays his hands on the king's hands
He says, "Open the window eastward"
He opens it
Elisha says, "Shoot"
He shoots
"The Lord's arrow of victory, the arrow of victory over Syria!"
"For you shall fight the Syrians in Aphek until you have made an end of them"
"Take the arrows"
He takes them
He says to the king of Israel, "Strike the ground with them"
He strikes three times and stops
The man of God is angry with him
"You should have struck five or six times"
"Then you would have struck down Syria until you had made an end of it"
"But now you will strike down Syria only three times"
Elisha dies
They bury him
Now bands of Moabites used to invade the land in the spring of the year
As a man is being buried, behold, a marauding band is seen
The man is thrown into the grave of Elisha
As soon as the man touches the bones of Elisha, he revives
He stands on his feet
Hazael king of Syria oppresses Israel all the days of Jehoahaz

Yet not like David his father
He does in all things as Joash his father had done
But the high places are not removed
The people still sacrifice and make offerings on the high places
As soon as the royal power is firmly in his hand
He strikes down his servants who have struck down the king his father
But he does not put to death the children of the murderers
According to what is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, where the Lord commands

"Nor shall children be put to death because of their fathers"

For the Lord sees that the affliction of Israel is very bitter

He does not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he makes Israel to sin
Pekah the son of Remaliah, his captain, conspires against him with fifty men of the people of Gilead
He strikes him down in Samaria, in the citadel of the king's house with Argob and Arieh
He puts him to death and reigns in his place
Now the rest of the deeds of Pekahiah and all that he did
Behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel
In the fifty-second year of Azariah king of Judah
Pekah the son of Remaliah begins to reign over Israel in Samaria
He reigns twenty years
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
He does not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which he makes Israel to sin
In the days of Pekah king of Israel
Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria comes
He captures Ijon, Abel-beth-maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, and Galilee
All the land of Naphtali
He carries the people captive to Assyria
Hoshea the son of Elah makes a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah
He strikes him down and puts him to death
He reigns in his place, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah
Now the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did
Behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel
In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel
Jotham the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, begins to reign
He is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign
He reigns sixteen years in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Jerusha the daughter of Zadok
He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that his father Uzziah had done
Nevertheless, the high places are not removed
The people still sacrifice and make offerings on the high places
He builds the upper gate of the house of the Lord
Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
In those days the Lord begins to send Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah against Judah
Jotham sleeps with his fathers
He is buried with his fathers in the city of David his father
Ahaz his son reigns in his place
In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah
Ahaz the son of Jotham, king of Judah, begins to reign
Ahaz is twenty years old when he begins to reign
He reigns sixteen years in Jerusalem
He does not do what is right in the eyes of the Lord his God, as his father David had done
He walks in the way of the kings of Israel
He even burns his son as an offering, according to the despicable practices of the nations
Whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel
He sacrifices and makes offerings on the high places and on the hills and under every green tree
Rezin king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, come up to wage war on Jerusalem
They besiege Ahaz but cannot conquer him
At that time Rezin the king of Syria recovers Elath for Syria
He drives the men of Judah from Elath
The Edomites come to Elath, where they dwell to this day
Ahaz sends messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria
"I am your servant and your son. Come up and rescue me from the hand of the king of Syria"
"And from the hand of the king of Israel, who are attacking me"
Ahaz also takes the silver and gold that is found in the house of the Lord
And in the treasures of the king's house
He sends a present to the king of Assyria
The king of Assyria listens to him
The king of Assyria marches up against Damascus and takes it
Carrying its people captive to Kir
He puts Rezin to death
King Ahaz goes to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria
When he sees the altar that is at Damascus
King Ahaz sends to Uriah the priest a model of the altar, and its pattern, exact in all its details
Uriah the priest builds the altar
In accordance with all that King Ahaz has sent from Damascus
Uriah the priest makes it, before King Ahaz arrives from Damascus
When the king comes from Damascus, the king views the altar
The king approaches the altar and goes up on it
He burns his burnt offering and his grain offering
He pours his drink offering and throws the blood of his peace offerings on the altar
The bronze altar that is before the Lord he removes from the front of the house
From the place between his altar and the house of the Lord
He puts it on the north side of his altar
King Ahaz commands Uriah the priest
"On the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening grain offering"
"And the king's burnt offering and his grain offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land"
"And their grain offering and their drink offering"
"And throw on it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice"
"But the bronze altar shall be for me to inquire by"
Uriah the priest does all this, as King Ahaz commands
King Ahaz cuts off the frames of the stands
He removes the basin from them
He takes down the sea from off the bronze oxen that are under it
He puts it on a stone pedestal
The covered way for the Sabbath that has been built inside the house
And the outer entrance for the king he removes from the house of the Lord
Because of the king of Assyria
Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
Ahaz sleeps with his fathers
He is buried with his fathers in the city of David
Hezekiah his son reigns in his place
In the twelfth year of Ahaz king of Judah
Hoshea the son of Elah begins to reign in Samaria over Israel
He reigns nine years
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
Yet not as the kings of Israel who are before him
Shalmaneser king of Assyria comes up against him
Hoshea becomes his vassal and pays him tribute
The king of Assyria finds treachery in Hoshea
For he has sent messengers to So, king of Egypt
He offers no tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year
Therefore the king of Assyria shuts him up and binds him in prison
The king of Assyria invades all the land
He comes to Samaria
He besieges it for three years
In the ninth year of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captures Samaria
He carries Israel away to Assyria
He places them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes
This occurs because the people of Israel have sinned against the Lord their God
Who brought them up out of the land of Egypt from under the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt
They fear other gods
They walk in the customs of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel
And in the customs that the kings of Israel have practiced
The people of Israel do secretly against the Lord their God things that are not right
They build for themselves high places in all their towns
From watchtower to fortified city
They set up for themselves pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree
There they make offerings on all the high places, as the nations do whom the Lord carries away before them
They do wicked things, provoking the Lord to anger
They serve idols, of which the Lord has said to them, "You shall not do this"
Yet the Lord warns Israel and Judah by every prophet and every seer
"Turn from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes"
"In accordance with all the Law that I commanded your fathers"
"And that I sent to you by my servants the prophets"
They do not listen but are stubborn, as their fathers had been
Who do not believe in the Lord their God
They despise his statutes and his covenant that he makes with their fathers
And the warnings that he gives them
They go after false idols and become false
They follow the nations that are around them
Concerning whom the Lord has commanded them that they should not do like them
They forsake all the commandments of the Lord their God
They make for themselves metal images of two calves
They make an Asherah
They worship all the host of heaven
They serve Baal
They burn their sons and their daughters as offerings
They use divination and omens
They sell themselves to do evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger
Therefore the Lord is very angry with Israel
He removes them out of his sight
None is left but the tribe of Judah only
Judah also does not keep the commandments of the Lord their God
They walk in the customs that Israel has practiced
The Lord rejects all the descendants of Israel
He afflicts them and gives them into the hand of plunderers
Until he has cast them out of his sight
When he has torn Israel from the house of David
They make Jeroboam the son of Nebat king
Jeroboam drives Israel from following the Lord
He makes them commit great sin
The people of Israel walk in all the sins that Jeroboam does
They do not depart from them
Until the Lord removes Israel out of his sight, as he has spoken by all his servants the prophets
So Israel is exiled from their own land to Assyria to this day
The king of Assyria brings people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim
He places them in the cities of Samaria instead of the people of Israel
They take possession of Samaria and dwell in its cities
When they first dwell there, they do not fear the Lord
Therefore the Lord sends lions among them, which kill some of them
The king of Assyria is told
"The nations that you have carried away and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the law of the god of the land"
"Therefore he has sent lions among them, and behold, they are killing them"
"Because they do not know the law of the god of the land"
The king of Assyria commands
"Send there one of the priests whom you carried away from there"
"Let him go and dwell there and teach them the law of the god of the land"
One of the priests whom they have carried away from Samaria comes and dwells in Bethel
He teaches them how they should fear the Lord
But every nation still makes gods of its own
They put them in the shrines of the high places that the Samaritans have made
Every nation in the cities in which they dwell
The men of Babylon make Succoth-benoth
The men of Cuth make Nergal
The men of Hamath make Ashima
The Avvites make Nibhaz and Tartak
The Sepharvites burn their children in the fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech
The gods of Sepharvaim
They also fear the Lord
They appoint from among themselves all sorts of people as priests of the high places
Who sacrifice for them in the shrines of the high places
So they fear the Lord but also serve their own gods
After the manner of the nations from among whom they have been carried away
To this day they do according to the former manner
They do not fear the Lord
They do not follow the statutes or the rules or the law or the commandment that the Lord commanded the children of Jacob
Whom he named Israel
The Lord makes a covenant with them and commands them
"You shall not fear other gods or bow yourselves to them or serve them or sacrifice to them"
"But you shall fear the Lord, who brought you out of the land of Egypt with great power and with an outstretched arm"
"You shall bow yourselves to him, and to him you shall sacrifice"
"And the statutes and the rules and the law and the commandment that he wrote for you"
"You shall always be careful to do"
"You shall not fear other gods"
"And you shall not forget the covenant that I have made with you"
"You shall not fear other gods"
"But you shall fear the Lord your God"
"And he will deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies"
However, they do not listen
They do according to their former manner
So these nations fear the Lord and also serve their carved images
Their children do likewise, and their children's children
As their fathers did, so they do to this day
In the third year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel
Hezekiah the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, begins to reign
He is twenty-five years old when he begins to reign
He reigns twenty-nine years in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Abi the daughter of Zechariah
He does what is right in the eyes of the Lord, according to all that David his father has done
He removes the high places and breaks the pillars and cuts down the Asherah
He breaks in pieces the bronze serpent that Moses has made
For until those days the people of Israel have made offerings to it
It is called Nehushtan
He trusts in the Lord, the God of Israel
So that there is none like him among all the kings of Judah after him
Nor among those who are before him
He holds fast to the Lord
He does not depart from following him
He keeps the commandments that the Lord commanded Moses
The Lord is with him
Wherever he goes out, he prospers
He rebels against the king of Assyria and will not serve him
He strikes down the Philistines as far as Gaza and its territory
From watchtower to fortified city
In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which is the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah, king of Israel
Shalmaneser king of Assyria comes up against Samaria and besieges it
At the end of three years they take it
In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel, Samaria is taken
The king of Assyria carries the Israelites away to Assyria
He puts them in Halah, and on the Habor, the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes
Because they do not obey the voice of the Lord their God
But transgress his covenant, even all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded
They neither listen nor obey
In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah
Sennacherib king of Assyria comes up against all the fortified cities of Judah and takes them
Hezekiah king of Judah sends to the king of Assyria at Lachish
"I have done wrong; withdraw from me. Whatever you impose on me I will bear"
The king of Assyria requires of Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold
Hezekiah gives him all the silver that is found in the house of the Lord
And in the treasuries of the king's house
At that time Hezekiah strips the gold from the doors of the temple of the Lord
And from the doorposts that Hezekiah king of Judah has overlaid
He gives it to the king of Assyria
The king of Assyria sends the Tartan, the Rab-saris, and the Rabshakeh with a great army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem
They go up and come to Jerusalem
When they arrive, they come and stand by the conduit of the upper pool
Which is on the highway to the Washer's Field
When they call for the king
There come out to them Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who is over the household
And Shebnah the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder
The Rabshakeh says to them
"Say to Hezekiah, 'Thus says the great king, the king of Assyria'"
"'What is this confidence that you have?'"
"'Do you think that mere words are strategy and power for war?'"
"'In whom do you now trust, that you have rebelled against me?'"
"'Behold, you are trusting now in Egypt, that broken reed of a staff'"
"'Which will pierce the hand of any man who leans on it'"
"'Such is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him'"
"'But if you say to me, "We trust in the Lord our God"'"
"'Is it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has removed'"
"'Saying to Judah and to Jerusalem, "You shall worship before this altar in Jerusalem"?'"
"'Come now, make a wager with my master the king of Assyria'"
"'I will give you two thousand horses, if you are able on your part to set riders on them'"
"'How then can you repulse a single captain among the least of my master's servants'"
"'When you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?'"
"'Moreover, is it without the Lord that I have come up against this place to destroy it?'"
"'The Lord said to me, "Go up against this land and destroy it"'"
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebnah, and Joah, say to the Rabshakeh
"Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, for we understand it"
"Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall"
The Rabshakeh says to them
"Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you"
"And not to the men sitting on the wall"
"Who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and to drink their own urine?"
The Rabshakeh stands and calls out in a loud voice in the language of Judah
"Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria!"
"Thus says the king: 'Do not let Hezekiah deceive you'"
"'For he will not be able to deliver you out of my hand'"
"'Do not let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by saying'"
"'"The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria"'"
"'Do not listen to Hezekiah'"
"'For thus says the king of Assyria'"
"'"Make your peace with me and come out to me'"
"'"Then each one of you will eat of his own vine, and each one of his own fig tree'"
"'"And each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern'"
"'"Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land'"
"'"A land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards'"
"'"A land of olive trees and honey, that you may live, and not die'"
"'"And do not listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying, 'The Lord will deliver us'"'"
"'Has any of the gods of the nations ever delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?'"
"'Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?'"
"'Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?'"
"'Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?'"
"'Who among all the gods of the lands have delivered their lands out of my hand'"
"'That the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?'"
The people are silent and answer him not a word
For the king's command is, "Do not answer him"
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who is over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, come to Hezekiah
With their clothes torn
They tell him the words of the Rabshakeh
As soon as King Hezekiah hears it, he tears his clothes
He covers himself with sackcloth and goes into the house of the Lord
He sends Eliakim, who is over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests
Covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz
They say to him, "Thus says Hezekiah"
"'This day is a day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace'"
"'Children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth'"
"'It may be that the Lord your God will hear all the words of the Rabshakeh'"
"'Whom his master the king of Assyria has sent to mock the living God'"
"'And will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard'"
"'Therefore lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left'"
When the servants of King Hezekiah come to Isaiah
Isaiah says to them, "Say to your master"
"'Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard'"
"'With which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me'"
"'Behold, I will put a spirit in him, so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land'"
"'And I will make him fall by the sword in his own land'"
The Rabshakeh returns and finds the king of Assyria fighting against Libnah
For he hears that the king has left Lachish
Now the king hears concerning Tirhakah king of Cush
"Behold, he has set out to fight against you"
He sends messengers again to Hezekiah
"Thus shall you speak to Hezekiah king of Judah"
"'Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you by promising that Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria'"
"'Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands'"
"'Devoting them to destruction'"
"'And shall you be delivered?'"
"'Have the gods of the nations delivered them'"
"'The nations that my fathers destroyed, Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Telassar?'"
"'Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"
Hezekiah receives the letter from the hand of the messengers and reads it
Hezekiah goes up to the house of the Lord
He spreads it before the Lord
Hezekiah prays before the Lord
"O Lord, the God of Israel, enthroned above the cherubim"
"You are the God, you alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth"
"You have made heaven and earth"
"Incline your ear, O Lord, and hear"
"Open your eyes, O Lord, and see"
"And hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God"
"Truly, O Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste the nations and their lands"
"And have cast their gods into the fire"
"For they were not gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone"
"Therefore they were destroyed"
"So now, O Lord our God, save us, please, from his hand"
"That all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you, O Lord, are God alone"
Isaiah the son of Amoz sends to Hezekiah
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'Your prayer to me about Sennacherib king of Assyria I have heard'"
"This is the word that the Lord has spoken concerning him"
"'She despises you, she scorns you, the virgin daughter of Zion'"
"'She wags her head behind you, the daughter of Jerusalem'"
"'Whom have you mocked and reviled?'"
"'Against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes to the heights?'"
"'Against the Holy One of Israel!'"
"'By your messengers you have mocked the Lord'"
"'And you have said, "With my many chariots I have gone up the heights of the mountains'"
"'"To the far recesses of Lebanon'"
"'"I felled its tallest cedars, its choicest cypresses'"
"'"I entered its farthest lodging place, its most fruitful forest'"
"'"I dug wells and drank foreign waters'"
"'"I dried up with the sole of my foot all the streams of Egypt"'"
"'Have you not heard that I determined it long ago?'"
"'I planned from days of old what now I bring to pass'"
"'That you should turn fortified cities into heaps of ruins'"
"'While their inhabitants, shorn of strength, are dismayed and confounded'"
"'And have become like plants of the field and like tender grass'"
"'Like grass on the housetops, blighted before it is grown'"
"'But I know your sitting down and your going out and coming in'"
"'And your raging against me'"
"'Because you have raged against me and your complacency has come into my ears'"
"'I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth'"
"'And I will turn you back on the way by which you came'"
"'And this shall be the sign for you: this year you shall eat what grows of itself'"
"'And in the second year what springs of the same'"
"'Then in the third year sow and reap and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit'"
"'And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward'"
"'For out of Jerusalem shall go a remnant, and out of Mount Zion a band of survivors'"
"'The zeal of the Lord will do this'"
"'Therefore thus says the Lord concerning the king of Assyria'"
"'He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there'"
"'Or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it'"
"'By the way that he came, by the same he shall return'"
"'And he shall not come into this city, declares the Lord'"
"'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David'"
That very night the angel of the Lord goes out
He strikes down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians
When people arise early in the morning, behold, these are all dead bodies
Sennacherib king of Assyria departs and goes home
He dwells at Nineveh
As he is worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god
Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, strike him down with the sword
They escape into the land of Ararat
Esarhaddon his son reigns in his place
In those days Hezekiah becomes sick and is at the point of death
Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz comes to him
"Thus says the Lord, 'Set your house in order, for you shall die; you shall not recover'"
Hezekiah turns his face to the wall and prays to the Lord
"Now, O Lord, please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart"
"And have done what is good in your sight"
Hezekiah weeps bitterly
Before Isaiah has gone out of the middle court, the word of the Lord comes to him
"Turn back, and say to Hezekiah the leader of my people"
"'Thus says the Lord, the God of David your father'"
"'"I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears'"
"'"Behold, I will heal you. On the third day you shall go up to the house of the Lord'"
"'"And I will add fifteen years to your life'"
"'"I will deliver you and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria'"
"'"And I will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant David's sake"'"
Isaiah says, "Bring a cake of figs"
They take and lay it on the boil
He recovers
Hezekiah says to Isaiah, "What shall be the sign that the Lord will heal me"
"And that I shall go up to the house of the Lord on the third day?"
Isaiah says, "This shall be the sign to you from the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he has promised"
"Shall the shadow go forward ten steps, or go back ten steps?"
Hezekiah answers, "It is an easy thing for the shadow to lengthen ten steps"
"Rather let the shadow go back ten steps"
Isaiah the prophet calls to the Lord
He brings the shadow back ten steps, by which it has gone down on the steps of Ahaz
At that time Merodach-baladan the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sends envoys with letters and a present to Hezekiah
For he hears that Hezekiah has been sick
Hezekiah welcomes them
He shows them all his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, his armory
All that is found in his storehouses
There is nothing in his house or in all his realm that Hezekiah does not show them
Isaiah the prophet comes to King Hezekiah
"What did these men say? And from where did they come to you?"
Hezekiah says, "They have come from a far country, from Babylon"
"What have they seen in your house?"
"They have seen all that is in my house"
"There is nothing in my storehouses that I did not show them"
Isaiah says to Hezekiah, "Hear the word of the Lord"
"'Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house'"
"'And that which your fathers have stored up till this day, shall be carried to Babylon'"
"'Nothing shall be left, says the Lord'"
"'And some of your own sons, who shall be born to you, shall be taken away'"
"'And they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon'"
Hezekiah says to Isaiah, "The word of the Lord that you have spoken is good"
For he thinks, "Why not, if there will be peace and security in my days?"
The rest of the deeds of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made the pool and the conduit
And brought water into the city, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
Hezekiah sleeps with his fathers
Manasseh his son reigns in his place
Manasseh is twelve years old when he begins to reign
He reigns fifty-five years in Jerusalem
His mother's name is Hephzibah
He does what is evil in the sight of the Lord
According to the despicable practices of the nations whom the Lord drove out before the people of Israel
He rebuilds the high places that Hezekiah his father has destroyed
He erects altars for Baal and makes an Asherah, as Ahab king of Israel had done
He worships all the host of heaven and serves them
He builds altars in the house of the Lord
Of which the Lord has said, "In Jerusalem will I put my name"
He builds altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the Lord
He burns his son as an offering
He practices soothsaying and augury
He deals with mediums and with necromancers
He does much evil in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger
The carved image of Asherah that he has made he sets in the house
Of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son
"In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel"
"I will put my name forever"
"And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander anymore out of the land that I gave to their fathers"
"If only they will be careful to do according to all that I have commanded them"
"And according to all the Law that my servant Moses commanded them"
They do not listen
Manasseh misleads them to do more evil than the nations had done whom the Lord destroyed before the people of Israel
The Lord says by his servants the prophets
"Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations"
"And has done things more evil than all that the Amorites did, who were before him"
"And has made Judah also to sin with his idols"
"Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'Behold, I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster'"
"'That the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle'"
"'And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria'"
"'And the plumb line of the house of Ahab'"
"'And I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down'"
"'And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage'"
"'And give them into the hand of their enemies'"
"'And they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies'"
"'Because they have done what is evil in my sight'"
"'And have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day'"
Moreover, Manasseh sheds very much innocent blood
Till he has filled Jerusalem from one end to another
Besides the sin that he makes Judah to sin
So that they do what is evil in the sight of the Lord
Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did, and the sin that he committed
Are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
Manasseh sleeps with his fathers

The servants of Amon conspire against him
They put the king to death in his house
But the people of the land strike down all those who have conspired against King Amon
The people of the land make Josiah his son king in his place
Now the rest of the acts of Amon that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sends Shaphan the son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the secretary, to the house of the Lord
"Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money that has been brought into the house of the Lord"
"Which the keepers of the threshold have collected from the people"
"And let it be given into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord"
"And let them give it to the workmen who are at the house of the Lord, repairing the house"
"That is, to the carpenters, and to the builders, and to the masons"
"And let them use it for buying timber and quarried stone to repair the house"
"But no accounting shall be asked from them for the money that is delivered into their hand"
"For they deal honestly"
Hilkiah the high priest says to Shaphan the secretary
"I have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord"
Hilkiah gives the book to Shaphan, and he reads it
Shaphan the secretary comes to the king and reports to the king
"Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house"
"And have delivered it into the hand of the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the Lord"
Shaphan the secretary tells the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book"
Shaphan reads it before the king
When the king hears the words of the Book of the Law, he tears his clothes
The king commands Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Micaiah, and Shaphan the secretary, and Asaiah the king's servant
"Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah"
"Concerning the words of this book that has been found"
"For great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us"
"Because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book"
"To do according to all that is written concerning us"
Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asaiah go to Huldah the prophetess
The wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe
Now she dwells in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter
They speak to her
She says to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel"
"'Tell the man who sent you to me'"
"'Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will bring disaster upon this place and upon its inhabitants'"
"'All the words of the book that the king of Judah has read'"
"'Because they have forsaken me and have made offerings to other gods'"
"'That they might provoke me to anger with all the work of their hands'"
"'Therefore my wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched'"
"'But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the Lord, thus shall you say to him'"
"'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Regarding the words that you have heard'"
"'"Because your heart was penitent, and you humbled yourself before the Lord'"
"'"When you heard how I spoke against this place and against its inhabitants'"
"'"That they should become a desolation and a curse'"
"'"And you have torn your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, declares the Lord'"
"'"Therefore, behold, I will gather you to your fathers'"
"'"And you shall be gathered to your grave in peace'"
"'"And your eyes shall not see all the disaster that I will bring upon this place"'"
They bring back word to the king
The king sends, and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem are gathered to him
The king goes up to the house of the Lord
And with him all the men of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the prophets
All the people, both small and great
He reads in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant that has been found in the house of the Lord
The king stands by the pillar and makes a covenant before the Lord
To walk after the Lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and all his soul
To perform the words of this covenant that are written in this book
All the people join in the covenant
The king commands Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the threshold
To bring out of the temple of the Lord all the vessels made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven
He burns them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron
He carries their ashes to Bethel
He deposes the priests whom the kings of Judah have ordained to make offerings in the high places
At the cities of Judah and around Jerusalem
Those also who make offerings to Baal, to the sun and the moon and the constellations and all the host of the heavens
He brings out the Asherah from the house of the Lord, outside Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron
He burns it at the brook Kidron and beats it to dust
He casts the dust of it upon the graves of the common people
He breaks down the houses of the male cult prostitutes who are in the house of the Lord
Where the women weave hangings for the Asherah
He brings all the priests out of the cities of Judah
He defiles the high places where the priests have made offerings, from Geba to Beersheba
He breaks down the high places of the gates that are at the entrance of the gate of Joshua the governor of the city
Which are on one's left at the gate of the city
However, the priests of the high places do not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem
But they eat unleavened bread among their brothers
He defiles Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom
That no one might burn his son or his daughter as an offering to Molech
He removes the horses that the kings of Judah have dedicated to the sun
At the entrance to the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech the chamberlain, which is in the precincts
He burns the chariots of the sun with fire
The altars on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah have made
And the altars that Manasseh has made in the two courts of the house of the Lord
The king breaks down and beats them down from there
He casts their dust into the brook Kidron
The king defiles the high places that are east of Jerusalem
To the south of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel has built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians
And for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites
He breaks in pieces the pillars and cuts down the Asherim
He fills their places with the bones of men
Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the high place erected by Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who makes Israel to sin
That altar and the high place he pulls down
He burns the high place and crushes it to dust
He burns the Asherah
As Josiah turns, he sees the tombs there on the mount
He sends and takes the bones out of the tombs
He burns them on the altar and defiles it
According to the word of the Lord that the man of God proclaimed, who had predicted these things
"What is that monument that I see?"
The men of the city tell him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah"
"And predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel"
"Let him be; let no man move his bones"
So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came out of Samaria
Josiah also removes all the shrines of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria
Which kings of Israel have made, provoking the Lord to anger
He does to them according to all that he has done at Bethel
He sacrifices all the priests of the high places who are there, on the altars
He burns human bones on them
Then he returns to Jerusalem
The king commands all the people, "Keep the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant"
For no such Passover has been kept since the days of the judges who judged Israel
Or during all the days of the kings of Israel or of the kings of Judah
But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover is kept to the Lord in Jerusalem
Moreover, Josiah puts away the mediums and the necromancers and the household gods and the idols
And all the abominations that are seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem
That he may establish the words of the law that are written in the book that Hilkiah the priest finds in the house of the Lord
Before him there is no king like him, who turns to the Lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might
According to all the Law of Moses
Nor does any like him arise after him
Still the Lord does not turn from the burning of his great wrath
By which his anger is kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh has provoked him
The Lord says, "I will remove Judah also out of my sight, as I have removed Israel"
"And I will cast off this city that I have chosen, Jerusalem, and the house of which I said, 'My name shall be there'"
Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?

He sends them against Judah to destroy it
According to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servants the prophets
Surely this comes upon Judah at the command of the Lord
To remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all that he has done
And also for the innocent blood that he has shed
For he fills Jerusalem with innocent blood
The Lord is not willing to pardon

As long as he lives
Isaiah son of Amoz sees concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah
Isaiah sees the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up
The train of his robe fills the temple
Seraphim stand above him, each with six wings
One calls to another: "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts"
"The whole earth is full of his glory"
The foundations of the thresholds shake at the voice
The house is filled with smoke
Isaiah says, "Woe is me! For I am lost"
"For I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips"
"For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts"
One of the seraphim flies to him, having in his hand a burning coal
He has taken it with tongs from the altar
He touches Isaiah's mouth with it
"Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin atoned for"
Isaiah hears the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?"
"Here I am! Send me"
The Lord says, "Go, and say to this people"
"'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive'"
"'Make the heart of this people dull, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes'"
"'Lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears'"
"'And understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed'"
Isaiah asks, "How long, O Lord?"
"Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without people"
"And the land is a desolate waste"

In the year that King Ahaz dies, Isaiah receives this oracle
In the year that the commander in chief, sent by Sargon king of Assyria, comes to Ashdod and fights against it and takes it
The Lord speaks by Isaiah, telling him to loose the sackcloth from his waist and take off his sandals from his feet
Isaiah does so, walking naked and barefoot
The Lord says, "As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years"
"As a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush"
"So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles"
"Both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered"
"The nakedness of Egypt"

The earth staggers like a drunkard
Isaiah prophesies: the Lord will swallow up death forever
He will wipe away tears from all faces
The reproach of his people he will take away from all the earth
It will be said on that day, "Behold, this is our God; we have waited for him"
"Let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation"
Isaiah speaks of a people walking in darkness who have seen a great light
Those dwelling in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone
For to us a child is born, to us a son is given
The government shall be upon his shoulder
His name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace
Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end
On the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it
With justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore
Isaiah speaks of a shoot from the stump of Jesse
A branch from his roots shall bear fruit
The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
The spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might
The spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord
He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear
With righteousness he shall judge the poor
He shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth
With the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked
The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the young goat
The calf and the lion and the fattened calf together
A little child shall lead them
The nursing child shall play over the hole of the cobra
The weaned child shall put his hand on the adder's den
They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain
For the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea
In that day the Lord will extend his hand a second time to recover the remnant of his people
He will raise a signal for the nations and will assemble the banished of Israel
He will gather the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth
Isaiah sees the day of the Lord coming, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger
To make the land a desolation and to destroy its sinners from it
The stars of the heavens and their constellations will not give their light
The sun will be dark at its rising, and the moon will not shed its light
Behold, the Lord will empty the earth and make it desolate
He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants
Isaiah speaks of new heavens and a new earth
The former things shall not be remembered or come into mind
But be glad and rejoice forever in that which he creates
For behold, he creates Jerusalem to be a joy, and her people to be a gladness
No more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress
No more shall there be an infant who lives but a few days
Or an old man who does not fill out his days
They shall build houses and inhabit them
They shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit
The wolf and the lamb shall graze together
The lion shall eat straw like the ox
They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain
Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, of the priests in Anathoth, receives the word of the Lord
In the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you"
"Before you were born I consecrated you"
"I appointed you a prophet to the nations"
Jeremiah says, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth"
The Lord says, "Do not say, 'I am only a youth'"
"For to all to whom I send you, you shall go"
"And whatever I command you, you shall speak"
The Lord puts out his hand and touches Jeremiah's mouth
"Behold, I have put my words in your mouth"
"See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms"
"To pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow"
"To build and to plant"
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah: "What do you see?"
"I see an almond branch"
"You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it"
The word of the Lord comes to him a second time: "What do you see?"
"I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north"
"Out of the north disaster shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land"
"For behold, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north"
"They shall come and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem"
Jeremiah prophesies the destruction of Jerusalem
The Lord tells him to go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem
Jeremiah goes to the house of the potter
He sees the potter working at his wheel
The vessel he is making of clay is spoiled in the potter's hand
He reworks it into another vessel, as it seems good to the potter to do
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah
"O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter has done?"
"Behold, like the clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel"
The Lord tells Jeremiah to go and buy a potter's earthenware flask
To take some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests
To go out to the Valley of the Son of Hinnom at the entry of the Potsherd Gate
To proclaim there the words the Lord tells him
Jeremiah does so and prophesies disaster
Then he breaks the flask in the sight of the men who go with him
"Thus says the Lord of hosts: So will I break this people and this city"
"As one breaks a potter's vessel, so that it can never be mended"
Pashhur the priest, who is chief officer in the house of the Lord, hears Jeremiah prophesying these things
Pashhur strikes Jeremiah the prophet and puts him in the stocks
The stocks are in the upper Benjamin Gate of the house of the Lord
The next day, when Pashhur releases Jeremiah from the stocks
Jeremiah says to him, "The Lord does not call your name Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side"
"For thus says the Lord: Behold, I will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends"
"They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on"
"And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon"
"He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword"
King Zedekiah sends Pashhur and Zephaniah the priest to Jeremiah
"Inquire of the Lord for us, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us"
"Perhaps the Lord will deal with us according to all his wonderful deeds"
"And will make him withdraw from us"
Jeremiah says to them, "Thus you shall say to Zedekiah"
"'Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands'"
"'With which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans'"
"'Who are besieging you outside the walls'"
"'I will gather them into the midst of this city'"
"'I myself will fight against you with outstretched hand and strong arm'"
"'In anger and in fury and in great wrath'"
The word that comes to Jeremiah from the Lord, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army fight against Jerusalem
And against all its cities
"Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah"
"'Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire'"
"'You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand'"
"'You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face'"
"'And you shall go to Babylon'"
The Lord tells Jeremiah to take a scroll and write on it all the words he has spoken
Concerning Israel and Judah and all the nations
From the day he spoke to him in the days of Josiah until this day
Jeremiah summons Baruch the son of Neriah
Baruch writes on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord
Jeremiah orders Baruch, "I am banned from going to the house of the Lord"
"So you are to go and read from the scroll that you have written at my dictation"
"The words of the Lord, in the hearing of the people"
In the fifth year of Jehoiakim, in the ninth month
All the people in Jerusalem and all the people who come from the cities of Judah proclaim a fast before the Lord
Baruch reads the words of Jeremiah from the scroll in the house of the Lord
In the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, in the upper court
At the entry of the New Gate of the Lord's house, in the hearing of all the people
Micaiah the son of Gemariah hears all the words of the Lord from the scroll
He goes down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber
All the officials are sitting there
Micaiah tells them all the words he has heard
The officials send Jehudi to Baruch, saying, "Take in your hand the scroll that you read"
"And come"
Baruch takes the scroll in his hand and comes to them
They say to him, "Sit down and read it"
Baruch reads it to them
When they hear all the words, they turn to one another in fear
They say to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king"
They ask Baruch, "Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"
Baruch answers them, "He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll"
The officials say to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are"
They go into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the secretary
They report all the words to the king
The king sends Jehudi to get the scroll
Jehudi takes it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary
He reads it to the king and all the officials who stand beside the king
It is the ninth month, and the king is sitting in the winter house
A fire is burning in the fire pot before him
As Jehudi reads three or four columns, the king cuts them off with a knife
He throws them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll is consumed
Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who hear all these words is afraid
Nor do they tear their garments
Even when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah urge the king not to burn the scroll, he will not listen to them
The king commands Jerahmeel the king's son and Seraiah and Shelemiah to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet
But the Lord hides them
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah after the king has burned the scroll
"Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll"
"Which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned"
Jeremiah takes another scroll and gives it to Baruch the secretary, the son of Neriah
Baruch writes on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah has burned in the fire
And many similar words are added to them
Zedekiah sends Jehucal and Zephaniah the priest to Jeremiah
"Please pray for us to the Lord our God"
Now Jeremiah is still going in and out among the people
For he has not yet been put in prison
The army of Pharaoh has come out of Egypt
When the Chaldeans who are besieging Jerusalem hear news of them, they withdraw from Jerusalem
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah
"Thus says the Lord, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me"
"'Behold, Pharaoh's army that came to help you is about to return to Egypt'"
"'And the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city'"
"'They shall capture it and burn it with fire'"
When the Chaldean army withdraws from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army
Jeremiah sets out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people
When he is at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry arrests him
"You are deserting to the Chaldeans"
Jeremiah says, "It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans"
The sentry will not listen to him
He seizes Jeremiah and brings him to the officials
The officials are enraged at Jeremiah
They strike him and imprison him in the house of Jonathan the secretary
For it has been made a prison
Jeremiah remains many days in the dungeon cells
King Zedekiah sends for him and receives him
The king questions him secretly in his house
"Is there any word from the Lord?"
Jeremiah says, "There is"
"You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon"
Jeremiah also says to King Zedekiah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people"
"That you have put me in prison?"
"Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, 'The king of Babylon will not come against you'"
"'And against this land'?"
"Please hear me, my lord the king: let my humble plea come before you"
"Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there"
King Zedekiah gives orders, and they commit Jeremiah to the court of the guard
They give him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city is gone
Jeremiah remains in the court of the guard
Shephatiah, Gedaliah, Jucal, and Pashhur hear the words that Jeremiah is saying to all the people
"Thus says the Lord: He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence"
"But he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live"
"He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live"
The officials say to the king, "Let this man be put to death"
"For he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city"
"And the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them"
"For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm"
King Zedekiah says, "Behold, he is in your hands"
"For the king can do nothing against you"
They take Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king's son
Which is in the court of the guard
They let Jeremiah down by ropes
There is no water in the cistern, but only mud
Jeremiah sinks in the mud
Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, hears that they have put Jeremiah into the cistern
The king is sitting in the Benjamin Gate
Ebed-melech goes from the king's house and says to the king
"My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet"
"By casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of hunger"
"For there is no bread left in the city"
The king commands Ebed-melech the Ethiopian
"Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies"
Ebed-melech takes the men with him
He goes to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse
He takes from there old rags and worn-out clothes
He lets them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah
Ebed-melech the Ethiopian says to Jeremiah
"Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes"
Jeremiah does so
They draw Jeremiah up with the ropes and lift him out of the cistern
Jeremiah remains in the court of the guard
King Zedekiah sends for Jeremiah and receives him at the third entrance of the temple of the Lord
The king says to Jeremiah, "I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me"
Jeremiah says to Zedekiah, "If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death?"
"And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me"
King Zedekiah swears secretly to Jeremiah, "As the Lord lives, who made our souls"
"I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of these men who seek your life"
Jeremiah says to Zedekiah, "Thus says the Lord, the God of hosts, the God of Israel"
"'If you will surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon'"
"'Then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire'"
"'And you and your house shall live'"
"'But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon'"
"'Then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire'"
"'And you shall not escape from their hand'"
King Zedekiah says to Jeremiah, "I am afraid of the Judeans who have deserted to the Chaldeans"
"Lest I be handed over to them and they abuse me"
Jeremiah says, "You shall not be given to them"
"Obey now the voice of the Lord in what I say to you, and it shall be well with you"
"And your life shall be spared"
"But if you refuse to surrender, this is the vision which the Lord has shown to me"
Zedekiah says to Jeremiah, "Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die"
When the city is broken into, all the officials of the king of Babylon come and sit in the middle gate
Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon
When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers see them, they flee
They go out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls
They go toward the Arabah
The army of the Chaldeans pursues them
They overtake Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho
When they have taken him, they bring him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at Riblah
The king of Babylon passes sentence on him
The king of Babylon slaughters the sons of Zedekiah at Riblah before his eyes
The king of Babylon also slaughters all the nobles of Judah
He puts out the eyes of Zedekiah
He binds him in chains to take him to Babylon
The Chaldeans burn the king's house and the house of the people
They break down the walls of Jerusalem
Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carries into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who are left in the city
Those who have deserted to him, and the people who remain
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard leaves in the land of Judah some of the poor people who own nothing
He gives them vineyards and fields at the same time
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gives command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard
"Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm"
"But deal with him as he tells you"
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rabsaris, Nergal-sharezer the Rabmag send
And all the chief officers of the king of Babylon send
They take Jeremiah from the court of the guard
They entrust him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, that he should take him home
Jeremiah dwells among the people
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah while he is shut up in the court of the guard
"Go, and say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian"
"'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and not for good'"
"'And they shall be accomplished before you on that day'"
"'But I will deliver you on that day, declares the Lord'"
"'And you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid'"
"'For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword'"
"'But you shall have your life as a prize of war, because you have put your trust in me, declares the Lord'"
The word that comes to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard releases him from Ramah
He had taken him bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who are being exiled to Babylon
The captain of the guard takes Jeremiah and says to him
"The Lord your God pronounced this disaster against this place"
"The Lord has brought it about, and has done as he said"
"Because you sinned against the Lord and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you"
"Now, behold, I release you today from the chains on your hands"
"If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come"
"And I will look after you well"
"But if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come"
"See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go"
Jeremiah goes to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam at Mizpah
He dwells with him among the people who are left in the land
When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men hear that the king of Babylon has appointed Gedaliah governor in the land
They come with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah
Gedaliah swears to them and their men
"Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans"
"Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you"
"As for me, I will dwell at Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us"
"But as for you, gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels"
"And dwell in your cities that you have taken"
Likewise, when all the Judeans who are in Moab and among the Ammonites hear that the king of Babylon has left a remnant in Judah
And has appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan
All the Judeans return from all the places to which they have been driven
They come to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah
They gather wine and summer fruits in great abundance
Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces in the open country come to Gedaliah at Mizpah
They say to him, "Do you know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?"
But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam will not believe them
Johanan the son of Kareah speaks secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah
"Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it"
"Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered"
"And the remnant of Judah would perish?"
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam says to Johanan the son of Kareah
"You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael"
In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, comes with ten men to Gedaliah at Mizpah
As they eat bread together there at Mizpah
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rise up
They strike down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword
They kill him, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land
Ishmael also strikes down all the Judeans who are with Gedaliah at Mizpah
And the Chaldean soldiers who happen to be there
On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knows of it
Eighty men arrive from Shechem and Shiloh and Samaria
With their beards shaved and their clothes torn, and their bodies gashed
Bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the Lord
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah comes out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he comes
As he meets them, he says to them, "Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam"
When they come into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughter them
They cast them into a cistern
But there are ten men among them who say to Ishmael
"Do not put us to death, for we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields"
So he does not put them to death with their companions
Now the cistern into which Ishmael casts all the bodies of the men whom he has struck down is the large cistern that King Asa has made
For defense against Baasha king of Israel
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah fills it with the slain
Ishmael takes captive all the rest of the people who are in Mizpah
The king's daughters and all the people who are left at Mizpah
Whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, has committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
Ishmael the son of Nethaniah takes them captive
He sets out to cross over to the Ammonites
When Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him hear of all the evil that Ishmael has done
They take all their men and go to fight against Ishmael
They come upon him at the great pool that is in Gibeon
When all the people who are with Ishmael see Johanan and all the leaders of the forces with him
They are glad
All the people whom Ishmael has carried away captive from Mizpah turn around
They come back and go to Johanan the son of Kareah
But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escapes from Johanan with eight men
He goes to the Ammonites
Johanan the son of Kareah and all the leaders of the forces with him take from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he has recovered from Ishmael
After he has struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam
Soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brings back from Gibeon
They set out and stay at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem
Intending to go to Egypt
Because of the Chaldeans
For they are afraid of them, because Ishmael has struck down Gedaliah whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the land
All the commanders of the forces, and Johanan and Jezaniah, and all the people from the least to the greatest, come near
They say to Jeremiah the prophet, "Let our plea for mercy come before you"
"And pray to the Lord your God for us, for all this remnant"
"Because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us"
"That the Lord your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do"
Jeremiah the prophet says to them, "I have heard you"
"Behold, I will pray to the Lord your God according to your request"
"And whatever the Lord answers you, I will tell you"
"I will keep nothing back from you"
They say to Jeremiah, "May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us"
"If we do not act according to all the word with which the Lord your God sends you to us"
"Whether it is good or bad, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we are sending you"
"That it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God"
At the end of ten days the word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah
He summons Johanan the son of Kareah and all the commanders of the forces who are with him
And all the people from the least to the greatest
He says to them, "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me"
"'To present your plea for mercy before him'"
"'If you will remain in this land, then I will build you up and not pull you down'"
"'I will plant you, and not pluck you up'"
"'For I relent of the disaster that I did to you'"
"'Do not fear the king of Babylon, of whom you are afraid'"
"'Do not fear him, declares the Lord, for I am with you, to save you and to deliver you from his hand'"
"'I will grant you mercy, that he may have mercy on you and let you remain in your own land'"
"'But if you say, "We will not remain in this land," disobeying the voice of the Lord your God'"
"'And saying, "No, we will go to the land of Egypt, where we shall not see war"'"
"'"Or hear the sound of the trumpet or be hungry for bread, and we will dwell there"'"
"'Then hear the word of the Lord, O remnant of Judah'"
"'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel'"
"'"If you set your faces to enter Egypt and go to live there"'"
"'"Then the sword that you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt"'"
"'"And the famine of which you are afraid shall follow close after you to Egypt"'"
"'"And there you shall die"'"
Johanan and all the commanders of the forces and all the people do not obey the voice of the Lord, to remain in the land of Judah
Johanan and all the commanders of the forces take all the remnant of Judah who have returned to live in the land of Judah
From all the nations to which they have been driven
The men, the women, the children, the king's daughters
And every person whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard has left with Gedaliah
Also Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch the son of Neriah
They come into the land of Egypt, for they do not obey the voice of the Lord
They arrive at Tahpanhes
The word of the Lord comes to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes
"Take in your hands large stones and hide them in the mortar in the pavement that is at the entrance to Pharaoh's palace in Tahpanhes"
"In the sight of the men of Judah"
"And say to them, 'Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel'"
"'Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant'"
"'And I will set his throne above these stones that I have hidden'"
"'And he will spread his royal canopy over them'"
Jeremiah does so
Ezekiel the son of Buzi, the priest, receives visions of God by the Chebar canal in the land of the Chaldeans
He is among the exiles
In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month
As he is among the exiles by the Chebar canal
The heavens open
He sees visions of God
The hand of the Lord is upon him there
He looks, and behold, a stormy wind comes out of the north
A great cloud, with brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually
In the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming metal
From the midst of it comes the likeness of four living creatures
They have a human likeness
Each has four faces, and each of them has four wings
Their legs are straight, and the soles of their feet are like the sole of a calf's foot
They sparkle like burnished bronze
Under their wings on their four sides they have human hands
The four of them have their faces and their wings thus
Their wings touch one another
Each one of them goes straight forward, without turning as they go
As for the likeness of their faces, each has a human face
The four have the face of a lion on the right side
The four have the face of an ox on the left side
The four have the face of an eagle
Such are their faces
Their wings are spread out above
Each creature has two wings, each of which touches the wing of another
While two cover their bodies
Each goes straight forward
Wherever the spirit would go, they go, without turning as they go
As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance is like burning coals of fire
Like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures
The fire is bright, and out of the fire goes forth lightning
The living creatures dart to and fro, like the appearance of a flash of lightning
Ezekiel looks at the living creatures
He beholds a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them
As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction
Their appearance is like the gleaming of beryl
The four have the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel
When they go, they go in any of their four directions without turning as they go
Their rims are tall and awesome
The rims of all four are full of eyes all around
When the living creatures go, the wheels go beside them
When the living creatures rise from the earth, the wheels rise
Wherever the spirit wants to go, they go
The spirit of the living creatures is in the wheels
Over the heads of the living creatures there is the likeness of an expanse
Shining like awe-inspiring crystal, spread out above their heads
Under the expanse their wings are stretched out straight, one toward another
Each creature has two wings covering its body
When they go, Ezekiel hears the sound of their wings
Like the sound of many waters, like the sound of the Almighty
A sound of tumult like the sound of an army
When they stand still, they let down their wings
There comes a voice from above the expanse over their heads
When they stand still, they let down their wings
Above the expanse over their heads there is the likeness of a throne
In appearance like sapphire
Seated above the likeness of a throne is a likeness with a human appearance
Ezekiel sees from what has the appearance of his waist and upward
Something like the appearance of fire enclosed all around
From what has the appearance of his waist and downward
He sees something like the appearance of fire
There is brightness around him
Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain
So is the appearance of the brightness all around
Such is the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord
When Ezekiel sees it, he falls on his face
He hears the voice of one speaking
The voice says to him, "Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you"
As he speaks to him, the Spirit enters into Ezekiel
The Spirit sets him on his feet
Ezekiel hears him speaking to him
The Lord says, "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel"
"To nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me"
"They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day"
"The descendants also are impudent and stubborn"
"I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God'"
"And whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house"
"They will know that a prophet has been among them"
"And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words"
"Though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on scorpions"
"Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks"
"For they are a rebellious house"
"You shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear"
"For they are a rebellious house"
"But you, son of man, hear what I say to you"
"Be not rebellious like that rebellious house"
"Open your mouth and eat what I give you"
Ezekiel looks, and behold, a hand is stretched out to him
Behold, a scroll of a book is in it
The Lord spreads it before him
It has writing on the front and on the back
There are written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe
The Lord says, "Son of man, eat whatever you find here"
"Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel"
Ezekiel opens his mouth, and the Lord gives him the scroll to eat
He says to him, "Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you"
"And fill your stomach with it"
Ezekiel eats it, and it is in his mouth as sweet as honey
The Spirit lifts Ezekiel up
He hears behind him the voice of a great earthquake
"Blessed be the glory of the Lord from its place!"
He hears the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touch one another
And the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of a great earthquake
The Spirit lifts him up and takes him away
He goes in bitterness in the heat of his spirit
The hand of the Lord is strong upon him
He comes to the exiles at Tel-abib, who are dwelling by the Chebar canal
He sits where they are dwelling
He sits there overwhelmed among them seven days
At the end of seven days, the word of the Lord comes to him
"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel"
"Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me"
The hand of the Lord is upon Ezekiel there
He says to him, "Arise, go out into the valley, and there I will speak with you"
Ezekiel arises and goes out into the valley
Behold, the glory of the Lord stands there, like the glory that he had seen by the Chebar canal
He falls on his face
The Spirit enters into him and sets him on his feet
The Lord speaks with him
"Go, shut yourself within your house"
"And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you"
"And you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people"
"And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth"
"So that you shall be mute and unable to reprove them"
"For they are a rebellious house"
"But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth"
"And you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God'"
"'He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse'"
"'For they are a rebellious house'"
The Lord says to Ezekiel, "And you, O son of man, take a brick"
"And lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem"
"And put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it"
"And cast up a mound against it"
"Set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it all around"
"And you, take an iron griddle, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city"
"And set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege"
"And press the siege against it"
"This is a sign for the house of Israel"
Ezekiel does so
The Lord tells Ezekiel to lie on his left side for 390 days, bearing the punishment of the house of Israel
Then to lie on his right side for 40 days, bearing the punishment of the house of Judah
Ezekiel does so
The Lord tells him what he shall eat and drink during these days
And that he shall bake his bread over human dung
Ezekiel says, "Ah, Lord God! Behold, I have never defiled myself"
The Lord allows him to use cow's dung instead
The Lord tells Ezekiel to take a sharp sword and use it as a barber's razor
To pass it over his head and his beard
Then to take balances for weighing and divide the hair
A third part he is to burn in the fire in the midst of the city
A third part he is to strike with the sword all around the city
A third part he is to scatter to the wind
And the Lord will unsheathe the sword after them
Ezekiel is to take a small number of hairs and bind them in the skirts of his robe
And of these again he is to take some and throw them into the midst of the fire
And burn them in the fire
From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel
This is Jerusalem that the Lord has set in the center of the nations
With countries all around her
The word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel
"Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them"
Ezekiel prophesies against the mountains
In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month
As Ezekiel sits in his house, with the elders of Judah sitting before him
The hand of the Lord God falls upon him there
He looks, and behold, a form that has the appearance of a man
Below what appears to be his waist is fire
Above his waist is something like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming metal
He puts out the form of a hand and takes Ezekiel by a lock of his head
The Spirit lifts him up between earth and heaven
Brings him in visions of God to Jerusalem
To the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north
Where is the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy
Behold, the glory of the God of Israel is there
Like the vision that Ezekiel had seen in the valley
The Lord says to him, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north"
Ezekiel lifts up his eyes toward the north
Behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, is this image of jealousy
"Son of man, do you see what they are doing?"
"The great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here"
"To drive me far from my sanctuary?"
"But you will see still greater abominations"
The Lord brings him to the entrance of the court
Ezekiel looks, and behold, there is a hole in the wall
"Son of man, dig in the wall"
Ezekiel digs in the wall
Behold, there is an entrance
"Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here"
Ezekiel goes in and looks
Behold, there is every form of creeping things and loathsome beasts
And all the idols of the house of Israel, carved on the wall all around
Before them stand seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel
With Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them
Each has his censer in his hand
The smoke of the cloud of incense goes up
"Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark?"
"Each in his room of pictures?"
"For they say, 'The Lord does not see us, the Lord has forsaken the land'"
"You will see still greater abominations that they commit"
The Lord brings him to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the Lord
Behold, there sit women weeping for Tammuz
"Have you seen this, O son of man?"
"You will see still greater abominations than these"
He brings him into the inner court of the house of the Lord
Behold, at the entrance of the temple of the Lord
Between the porch and the altar
Are about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the Lord
And their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east
"Have you seen this, O son of man?"
"Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations that they commit here?"
"That they should fill the land with violence and provoke me still further to anger?"
"Behold, they put the branch to their nose"
"Therefore I will act in wrath"
"My eye will not spare, nor will I have pity"
"And though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them"
He cries in Ezekiel's ears with a loud voice
"Bring near the executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand"
Behold, six men come from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north
Each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand
Among them is a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist
They go in and stand beside the bronze altar
Now the glory of the God of Israel has gone up from the cherub on which it rested
To the threshold of the house
The Lord calls to the man clothed in linen, who has the writing case at his waist
"Pass through the city, through Jerusalem"
"And put a mark on the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it"
To the others he says in Ezekiel's hearing
"Pass through the city after him, and strike"
"Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity"
"Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women"
"But touch no one on whom is the mark"
"And begin at my sanctuary"
They begin with the elders who are before the house
"Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out"
They go out and strike in the city
While they are striking, and Ezekiel is left alone
He falls upon his face and cries out
"Ah, Lord God! Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?"
"The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great"
"The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice"
"For they say, 'The Lord has forsaken the land, and the Lord does not see'"
"As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity"
"I will bring their deeds upon their heads"
Behold, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brings back word
"I have done as you commanded me"
Ezekiel looks, and behold, on the expanse that is over the heads of the cherubim
There appears above them something like a sapphire, in appearance like a throne
The Lord says to the man clothed in linen
"Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim"
"Fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city"
He goes in before Ezekiel's eyes
Now the cherubim are standing on the south side of the house, when the man goes in
A cloud fills the inner court
The glory of the Lord goes up from the cherub to the threshold of the house
The house is filled with the cloud
The court is filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord
The sound of the wings of the cherubim is heard as far as the outer court
Like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks
When the Lord commands the man clothed in linen
"Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim"
He goes in and stands beside a wheel
A cherub stretches out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire
That is between the cherubim, and takes some of it
And puts it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who takes it and goes out
The cherubim appear to have the form of a human hand under their wings
Ezekiel looks, and behold, there are four wheels beside the cherubim
One beside each cherub
The appearance of the wheels is like sparkling beryl
As for their appearance, the four have the same likeness
As if a wheel were within a wheel
When they go, they go in any of their four directions without turning as they go
Their whole body, their rims, and their spokes, their wings, and the wheels are full of eyes all around
The wheels that the four of them have
As for the wheels, they are called in Ezekiel's hearing "the whirling wheels"
Each one has four faces
The first face is the face of the cherub
The second face is a human face
The third face is the face of a lion
The fourth is the face of an eagle
The cherubim mount up
These are the living creatures that Ezekiel saw by the Chebar canal
When the cherubim go, the wheels go beside them
When the cherubim lift up their wings to mount up from the earth
The wheels do not turn from beside them
When they stand still, these stand still
When they mount up, these mount up with them
For the spirit of the living creatures is in them
The glory of the Lord goes out from the threshold of the house
It stands over the cherubim
The cherubim lift up their wings and mount up from the earth before Ezekiel's eyes as they go out
With the wheels beside them
They stand at the entrance of the east gate of the house of the Lord
The glory of the God of Israel is over them
These are the living creatures that Ezekiel saw underneath the God of Israel by the Chebar canal
He knows that they are cherubim
Each has four faces, and each four wings
And underneath their wings the likeness of human hands
As for the likeness of their faces, they are the same faces whose appearance Ezekiel had seen by the Chebar canal
Each one of them goes straight forward
The Spirit lifts Ezekiel up and brings him to the east gate of the house of the Lord
Which faces east
Behold, at the entrance of the gateway there are twenty-five men
Among them Ezekiel sees Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah
Princes of the people
The Lord says to him, "Son of man, these are the men who devise iniquity"
"And who give wicked counsel in this city"
"Who say, 'The time is not near to build houses'"
"'This city is the cauldron, and we are the meat'"
"Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man"
The Spirit of the Lord falls upon Ezekiel
He says to him, "Say, Thus says the Lord"
"'So you think, O house of Israel'"
"'For I know the things that come into your mind'"
"'You have multiplied your slain in this city'"
"'And have filled its streets with the slain'"
"'Therefore thus says the Lord God'"
"'"Your slain whom you have laid in the midst of it, they are the meat'"
"'"And this city is the cauldron'"
"'"But you shall be brought out of the midst of it'"
As Ezekiel is prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah dies
Ezekiel falls on his face and cries out with a loud voice
"Ah, Lord God! Will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?"
The word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel
The glory of the Lord goes up from the midst of the city
It stands on the mountain that is on the east side of the city
The Spirit lifts Ezekiel up and brings him in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea
To the exiles
The vision that he has seen goes up from him
Ezekiel tells the exiles all the things that the Lord has shown him
The word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel in the twelfth year of the exile
In the tenth month, on the fifth day of the month
A fugitive from Jerusalem comes to him
"The city has been struck down"
Now the hand of the Lord has been upon Ezekiel the evening before the fugitive came
The Lord has opened his mouth by the time the man comes to him in the morning
His mouth is opened, and he is no longer mute
The word of the Lord comes to Ezekiel
"Son of man, the inhabitants of these waste places in the land of Israel keep saying"
"'Abraham was only one man, yet he got possession of the land'"
"'But we are many; the land is surely given us to possess'"
Ezekiel prophesies to them
Daniel and his companions are taken into exile in Babylon
In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon comes to Jerusalem and besieges it
The Lord gives Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand
With some of the vessels of the house of God
He brings them to the land of Shinar, to the house of his god
He places the vessels in the treasury of his god
The king tells Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch
To bring some of the people of Israel, both of the royal family and of the nobility
Youths without blemish, of good appearance and skillful in all wisdom
Endowed with knowledge, understanding learning, and competent to stand in the king's palace
To teach them the literature and language of the Chaldeans
The king assigns them a daily portion of the food that the king eats
And of the wine that he drinks
They are to be educated for three years
At the end of that time they are to stand before the king
Among these are Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah of the tribe of Judah
The chief of the eunuchs gives them names
Daniel is called Belteshazzar
Hananiah is called Shadrach
Mishael is called Meshach
Azariah is called Abednego
Daniel resolves that he will not defile himself with the king's food
Or with the wine that he drinks
He asks the chief of the eunuchs to allow him not to defile himself
God gives Daniel favor and compassion in the sight of the chief of the eunuchs
The chief of the eunuchs says to Daniel
"I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and your drink"
"For why should he see that you were in worse condition than the youths who are of your own age?"
"So you would endanger my head with the king"
Daniel says to the steward whom the chief of the eunuchs has assigned over Daniel and his companions
"Test your servants for ten days"
"Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink"
"Then let our appearance and the appearance of the youths who eat the king's food be observed by you"
"And deal with your servants according to what you see"
The steward agrees to this and tests them for ten days
At the end of ten days it is seen that they are better in appearance and fatter in flesh
Than all the youths who eat the king's food
The steward takes away their food and the wine they were to drink
He gives them vegetables
As for these four youths, God gives them learning and skill in all literature and wisdom
Daniel has understanding in all visions and dreams
At the end of the time, when the king has commanded that they should be brought in
The chief of the eunuchs brings them in before Nebuchadnezzar
The king speaks with them
Among all of them none is found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
They stand before the king
In every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king inquires of them
He finds them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that are in all his kingdom
Daniel continues until the first year of King Cyrus
In the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
Nebuchadnezzar has dreams
His spirit is troubled, and his sleep leaves him
The king commands that the magicians, the enchanters, the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans be summoned
To tell the king his dreams
They come in and stand before the king
The king says to them, "I had a dream, and my spirit is troubled to know the dream"
The Chaldeans say to the king in Aramaic
"O king, live forever! Tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation"
The king answers and says to the Chaldeans
"The word from me is firm: if you do not make known to me the dream and its interpretation"
"You shall be torn limb from limb, and your houses shall be laid in ruins"
"But if you show the dream and its interpretation, you shall receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor"
"Therefore show me the dream and its interpretation"
They answer a second time
"Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show its interpretation"
The king answers, "I know with certainty that you are trying to gain time"
"Because you see that the word from me is firm"
"If you do not make the dream known to me, there is but one sentence for you"
"You have agreed to speak lying and corrupt words before me till the times change"
"Therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me its interpretation"
The Chaldeans answer the king
"There is not a man on earth who can meet the king's demand"
"For no great and powerful king has asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or Chaldean"
"The thing that the king asks is difficult, and no one can show it to the king except the gods"
"Whose dwelling is not with flesh"
Because of this the king is angry and very furious
He commands that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed
The decree goes out, and the wise men are about to be killed
They seek Daniel and his companions, to kill them
Daniel replies with prudence and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king's guard
Who has gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon
"Why is the decree of the king so urgent?"
Arioch makes the matter known to Daniel
Daniel goes in and asks the king to appoint him a time
That he might show the interpretation to the king
Daniel goes to his house and makes the matter known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions
He tells them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery
So that Daniel and his companions may not be destroyed with the rest of the wise men of Babylon
The mystery is revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night
Daniel blesses the God of heaven
"Blessed be the name of God forever and ever"
"To whom belong wisdom and might"
"He changes times and seasons"
"He removes kings and sets up kings"
"He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding"
"He reveals deep and hidden things"
"He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him"
"To you, O God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise"
"For you have given me wisdom and might"
"And have now made known to me what we asked of you"
"For you have made known to us the king's matter"
Daniel goes in to Arioch, whom the king has appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon
He says to him, "Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon"
"Bring me in before the king, and I will show the king the interpretation"
Arioch brings Daniel in haste before the king
"I have found among the exiles from Judah a man who will make known to the king the interpretation"
The king declares to Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar
"Are you able to make known to me the dream that I have seen and its interpretation?"
Daniel answers the king
"No wise men, enchanters, magicians, or astrologers can show to the king the mystery that the king has asked"
"But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries"
"And he has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will be in the latter days"
"Your dream and the visions of your head as you lay in bed are these"
"To you, O king, as you lay in bed came thoughts of what would be after this"
"And he who reveals mysteries made known to you what is to be"
"But as for me, this mystery has been revealed to me"
"Not because of any wisdom that I have more than all the living"
"But in order that the interpretation may be made known to the king"
"And that you may know the thoughts of your mind"
"You saw, O king, and behold, a great image"
"This image, mighty and of exceeding brightness, stood before you"
"And its appearance was frightening"
"The head of this image was of fine gold"
"Its chest and arms of silver"
"Its middle and thighs of bronze"
"Its legs of iron"
"Its feet partly of iron and partly of clay"
"As you looked, a stone was cut out by no human hand"
"And it struck the image on its feet of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces"
"Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, all together were broken in pieces"
"And became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors"
"And the wind carried them away, so that not a trace of them could be found"
"But the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth"
"This was the dream"
"Now we will tell the king its interpretation"
"You, O king, the king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the might, and the glory"
"And into whose hand he has given, wherever they dwell, the children of man, the beasts of the field, and the birds of the heavens"
"Making you rule over them all, you are the head of gold"
"Another kingdom inferior to you shall arise after you"
"And yet a third kingdom of bronze, which shall rule over all the earth"
"And there shall be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron"
"Because iron breaks to pieces and shatters all things"
"And like iron that crushes, it shall break and crush all these"
